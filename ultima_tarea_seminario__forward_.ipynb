              " ' For nearly fifty years, Isaac Asimov thrilled millions of readers with his internationally \\nbestselling Foundation Series, a spell-binding tale of the future that spans hundreds of \\nyears and dozens of worlds. Here, now, is Forward the Foundation, the seventh and final \\nvolume in the series. Completed just before his death, it is the Grand Master’s last gift to \\nhis legions of admirers.\\n\\nHere, at last, is the story Asimov fans have been waiting for, an exciting tale of danger, \\nintrigue, and suspense that chronicles the second half of hero Hari Seldon’s life as he \\nstruggles to perfect his revolutionary Theory of Psychohistory and establish the means \\nby which the survival of humanity will be ensured: Foundation. For, as Seldon and his \\nloyal band of followers know, the mighty Galactic Empire is crumbling, and its \\ninevitable destruction will wreak havoc Galaxy-wide ...\\n\\nA resounding tour de force, Forward the Foundation brings full circle Asimov’s \\nrenowned Foundation epic. It is the crowning achievement of a great writer’s life, and a \\nstunning testament to the creative genius of Isaac Asimov.\\n\\nIsaac Asimov began his Foundation Series at the age of twenty-one, not realizing that it \\nwould one day be considered a cornerstone of science fiction. During his legendary \\ncareer, Asimov penned over 470 books on subjects ranging from science to Shakespeare \\nto history, though he was most loved for his award-winning science fiction sagas, which \\ninclude the Robot, Empire, and Foundation series. Named a Grand Master of Science \\nFiction by the Science Fiction Writers of America, Asimov entertained and educated \\nreaders of all ages for close to five decades. He died, at the age of seventy-two, in April \\n1997.\\n\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\n For all my loyal readers\\n\\n',\n",

While there is no question that Eto Demerzel was the real \\npower in thegovernment during much of the reign of Emperor Cleon I, historians are \\ndivided as to the nature of his rule. The classic interpretation is that he was another in \\nthe long line of strong and ruthless oppressors in the last century of the undivided \\nGalactic Empire, but there are revisionist views that have surfaced and that insist his \\nwas, if a despotism, a benevolent one. Much is made, in this view, of his relationship \\nwith Hari Seldon though that remains forever uncertain, particularly during the unusual \\nepisode of Laskin Joranum, whose meteoric rise--\\n\\nENCYCLOPEDIA GALACTICA *\\n\\n * All quotations from theEncyclopedia Galactica here reproduced are taken from \\nthe 116th Edition, published 1,020 F.E. by the Encyclopedia Galactica Publishing \\nCo., Terminus, with permission of the publishers.\\n\\n',\n",
              " ' 1\\n\\n  \\n\\n      “I tell you again, Hari,” said Yugo Amaryl, “that your friend Demerzel is in deep \\ntrouble.” He emphasized the word “friend” very lightly and with unmistakable air of \\ndistaste.\\n\\nHari Seldon detected the sour note and ignored it. He looked up from his tricomputer \\nand said, “I tell you again, Yugo, that that’s nonsense.” And then--with a trace of \\nannoyance, just a trace--he added, “Why are you taking up my time by insisting?”\\n\\n“Because I think it’s important.” Amaryl sat down defiantly. It was a gesture that \\nindicated he was not going to be moved easily. Here he was and here he would stay.\\n\\nEight years before, he had been a heatsinker in the Dahl Sector--as low on the social \\nscale as it was possible to be. He had been lifted out of that position by Seldon made \\ninto a mathematician and an intellectual--more than that, into a psychohistorian.\\n\\nNever for one minute did he forget what he had been and who he was now and to whom \\nhe owed the change. That meant that if he had to speak harshly to Hari Seldon--for \\nSeldon’s own good--no consideration of respect and love for the older man and no \\nregard for his own career would stop him. He owed such harshness--and much more--to \\nSeldon.\\n\\n“Look, Hari,” he said, chopping at the air with his left hand, “for some reason that is \\nbeyond my understanding, you think highly of this Demerzel, but I don’t. No one whose \\nopinion I respect--except you--thinks well of him. I don’t care what happens to him \\npersonally, Hari, but as long as I thinkyou do, I have no choice but to bring this to your \\nattention.”\\n\\nSeldon smiled, as much at the other’s earnestness as at what he considered to be the \\nuselessness of his concern. He was fond of Yugo Amaryl--more than fond. Yugo was one \\nof the four people he had encountered during that short period of his life when he was in \\nflight across the face of the planet Trantor--Eto Demerzel, Dors Venabili, Yugo Amaryl, \\nand Raych--four, the likes of which he had not found since.\\n\\nIn a particular and, in each case, different way, these four were indispensable to him--\\nYugo Amaryl, because of his quick understanding of the principles of psychohistory and \\nof his imaginative probings into new areas. It was comforting to know that if anything \\nhappened to Seldon himself before the mathematics of the field could be completely \\nworked out--and how slowly it proceeded, and how mountainous the obstacles there \\n\\n',\n",
              " 'would at least remain one good mind that would continue the research.\\n\\nHe said, “I’m sorry, Yugo. I don’t mean to be impatient with you or to reject out of hand \\nwhatever it is you are so anxious to make me understand. It’s just this job of mine; it’s \\nthis business of being a department head--”\\n\\nAmaryl found it his turn to smile and he repressed a slight chuckle. “I’m sorry, Hari, and \\nI shouldn’t laugh, but you have no natural aptitude for the position.”\\n\\n“As well I know, but I’ll have to learn. I have to seem to be doing something harmless \\nand there is nothing--nothing--more harmless than being the head of the Mathematics \\nDepartment at Streeling University. I can fill my day with unimportant tasks, so that no \\none need know or ask about the course of our psychohistorical research, but the trouble \\nis, Ido fill my day with unimportant tasks and I have insufficient time to--” His eyes \\nglanced around his office at the material stored in computers to which only he and \\nAmaryl had the key and which, even if anyone else stumbled upon them, had been \\ncarefully phrased in an invented symbology that no one else would understand.\\n\\nAmaryl said, “Once you work your way further into your duties, you’ll begin to delegate \\nand then you’ll have more time.”\\n\\n“I hope so,” said Seldon dubiously. “But tell me, what is it about Eto Demerzel that is so \\nimportant?”\\n\\n“Simply that Eto Demerzel, our great Emperor’s First Minister, is busily creating an \\ninsurrection.”\\n\\nSeldon frowned. “Why would he want to do that?”\\n\\n“I didn’t say he wants to. He’s simply doing it--whether he knows it or not--and with \\nconsiderable help from some of his political enemies. That’s all right with me, you \\nunderstand. I think that, under ideal conditions, it would be a good thing to have him out \\nof the Palace, off Trantor . . . beyond the Empire, for that matter. But you think highly of \\nhim, as I’ve said, and so I’m warning you, because I suspect that you are not following \\nthe recent political course of events as closely as you should.”\\n\\n“There are more important things to do,” said Seldon mildly.\\n\\n“Like psychohistory. I agree. But how are we going to develop psychohistory with any \\nhope of success if we remain ignorant of politics? I mean, present-day politics. Now--\\nnow--is the time when the present is turning into the future. We can’t just study the past. \\nWe know what happened in the past. It’s against the present and the near future that we \\n\\n',\n",
              " 'can check our results.”\\n\\n“It seems to me,” said Seldon, “that I have heard this argument before.”\\n\\n“And you’ll hear it again. It doesn’t seem to do me any good to explain this to you.”\\n\\nSeldon sighed, sat back in his chair, and regarded Amaryl with a smile. The younger \\nman could be abrasive, but he took psychohistory seriously--and that repaid all.\\n\\nAmaryl still had the mark of his early years as a heatsinker. He had the broad shoulders \\nand the muscular build of one who had been used to hard physical labor. He had not \\nallowed his body to turn flabby and that was a good thing, for it inspired Seldon to resist \\nthe impulse to spend all of his time at the desk as well. He did not have Amaryl’s sheer \\nphysical strength, but he still had his own talents as a Twister--for all that he had just \\nturned forty and could not keep it up forever. But for now, he would continue. Thanks to \\nhis daily workouts, his waist was still trim, his legs and arms firm.\\n\\nHe said, “This concern for Demerzel cannot be purely a matter of his being a friend of \\nmine. You must have some other motive.”\\n\\n“There’s no puzzle to that. As long as you’re a friend of Demerzel, your position here at \\nthe University is secure and you can continue to work on psychohistorical research.”\\n\\n“There you are. So I do have a reason to be friends with him. It isn’t beyond your \\nunderstanding at all.”\\n\\n“You have an interest incultivating him. That, I understand. But as for friendship--that, I \\ndon’t understand. However--if Demerzel lost lower, quite apart from the effect it might \\nhave on your position, then Cleon himself would be running the Empire and the rate of \\nits decline would increase. Anarchy might then be upon us before we have worked out \\nall the implications of psychohistory and made it possible for the science to save all \\nhumanity.”\\n\\n“I see. --but, you know, I honestly don’t think that we’re going to work out \\npsychohistory in time to prevent the Fall of the Empire.”\\n\\n“Even if we could not prevent the Fall, we could cushion the effects, couldn’t we?”\\n\\n“Perhaps.”\\n\\n“There you are, then. The longer we have to work in peace, the greater the chance we \\nwill have to prevent the Fall or, at least, ameliorate the effects. Since that is the case, \\n\\n',\n",
              " 'working backward, it may be necessary to save Demerzel, whether we--or, at least, I--\\nlike it or not.”\\n\\n“Yet you just said that you would like to see him out of the Palace and away from \\nTrantor and beyond the Empire.”\\n\\n“Yes, under ideal conditions, I said. But we are not living under ideal conditions and we \\nneed our First Minister, even if he is an instrument of repression and despotism.”\\n\\n“I see. But why do you think the Empire is so close to dissolution that the loss of a First \\nMinister will bring it about?”\\n\\n“Are you using it for predictions? We haven’t even gotten the framework in place. What \\npredictions can you make?”\\n\\n“Psychohistory.”\\n\\n“There’s intuition, Hari.”\\n\\n“There’salways been intuition. We want something more, don’t we? We want a \\nmathematical treatment that will give us probabilities of specific future developments \\nunder this condition or that. If intuition suffices to guide us, we don’t need \\npsychohistory at all.”\\n\\n“It’s not necessarily a matter of one or the other, Hari. I’m talking about both: the \\ncombination, which may be better than either--at least until psychohistory is perfected.”\\n\\n“If ever,” said Seldon. “But tell me, where does this danger to Demerzel arise? What is it \\nthat is likely to harm him or overthrow him? Are we talking about Demerzel’s \\noverthrow?”\\n\\n“Yes,” said Amaryl and a grim look settled on his face.\\n\\n“Then tell me. Have pity on my ignorance.”\\n\\nAmaryl flushed. “You’re being condescending, Hari. Surely you’ve heard of Jo-Jo \\nJoranum.”\\n\\n“Certainly. He’s a demagogue-- Wait, where’s he from? Nishaya, right? A very \\nunimportant world. Goat herding, I think. High-quality cheeses.”\\n\\n“That’s it. Not just a demagogue, however. He commands a strong following and it’s \\n\\n',\n",
              " 'getting stronger. He aims, he says, for social justice and greater political involvement by \\nthe people.”\\n\\n“Yes,” said Seldon. “I’ve heard that much. His slogan is: ‘Government belongs to the \\npeople.’“\\n\\n“Not quite, Hari. He says: ‘Government is the people.’“\\n\\nSeldon nodded. “Well, you know, I rather sympathize with the thought.”\\n\\n“So do I. I’m all for it--if Joranum meant it. But he doesn’t, except as a stepping-stone. \\nIt’s a path, not a goal. He wants to get rid of Demerzel. After that it will be easy to \\nmanipulate Cleon. Then Joranum will take the throne himself andhe will be the people. \\nYou’ve told me yourself that there have been a number of episodes of this sort in \\nImperial history--and these days the Empire is weaker and less stable than it used to be. \\nA blow which, in earlier centuries, merely staggered it might now shatter it. The Empire \\nwill welter in civil war and never recover and we won’t have psychohistory in place to \\nteach us what must be done.”\\n\\n“Yes, I see your point, but surely it’s not going to be that easy to get rid of Demerzel.”\\n\\n“You don’t know how strong Joranum is growing.”\\n\\n“It doesn’t matter how strong he’s growing.” A shadow of thought seemed to pass over \\nSeldon’s brow. “I wonder that his parents came to name him Jo-Jo. There’s something \\njuvenile about that name.”\\n\\n“His parents had nothing to do with it. His real name is Laskin, a very common name on \\nNishaya. He chose Jo-Jo himself, presumably from the first syllable of his last name.”\\n\\n“The more fool he, wouldn’t you say?”\\n\\n“No, I wouldn’t. His followers shout it Jo . . . Jo . . . Jo . . . Jo’--over and over. It’s \\nhypnotic.”\\n\\n“Well,” said Seldon, making a move to return to his tricomputer and adjust the \\nmultidimensional simulation it had created, “we’ll see what happens.”\\n\\n“Can you be that casual about it? I’m telling you the danger is imminent.”\\n\\n“No, it isn’t,” said Seldon, eyes steely, his voice suddenly hardening. “You don’t have all \\nthe facts.”\\n\\n',\n",
              " '“What facts don’t I have?”\\n\\n“We’ll discuss that another time, Yugo. For now, continue with your work and let me \\nworry about Demerzel and the state of the Empire.”\\n\\nAmaryl’s lips tightened, but the habit of obedience to Seldon was strong. “Yes, Hari.”\\n\\nBut not overwhelmingly strong. He turned at the door and said, “You’re making a \\nmistake, Hari.”\\n\\nSeldon smiled slightly. “I don’t think so, but I have heard your warning and I will not \\nforget. Still, all will be well.”\\n\\nAnd as Amaryl left, Seldon’s smile faded. --Would, indeed, all be well?\\n\\n  \\n\\n 2\\n\\n  \\n\\n      But Seldon, while he did not forget Amaryl’s warning, did not think of it with any \\ngreat degree of concentration. His fortieth birthday came and went--with the usual \\npsychological blow.\\n\\nForty! He was not young any longer. Life no longer stretched before him as a vast \\nuncharted field, its horizon lost in the distance. He had been on Trantor for eight years \\nand the time had passed quickly. Another eight years and he would be nearly fifty. Old \\nage would be looming.\\n\\nAnd he had not even made a decent beginning in psychohistory? Yugo Amaryl spoke \\nbrightly of laws and worked out his equations by making daring assumptions based on \\nintuition. But how could one possibly test those assumptions? Psychohistory was not yet \\nan experimental science. The complete study of psychohistory would require \\nexperiments that would involve worlds of people, centuries of time--and a total lack of \\nethical responsibility.\\n\\nIt posed an impossible problem and he resented having to spend any time whatever on \\ndepartmental tasks, so he walked home at the end of the day in a morose mood.\\n\\nOrdinarily he could always count on a walk through the campus to rouse his spirits. \\n\\n',\n",
              " 'Streeling University was high-domed and the campus gave the feeling of being out in \\nthe open without the necessity of enduring the kind of weather he had experienced on \\nhis one (and only) visit to the Imperial Palace. There were trees, lawns, walks, almost as \\nthough he were on the campus of his old college on his home world of Helicon.\\n\\nThe illusion of cloudiness had been arranged for the day with the sunlight (no sun, of \\ncourse, just sunlight) appearing and disappearing at odd intervals. And it was a little \\ncool, just a little.\\n\\nIt seemed to Seldon that the cool days came a little more frequently than they used to. \\nWas Trantor saving energy? Was it increasing inefficiency? Or (and he scowled inwardly \\nas he thought it) was he getting old and was his blood getting thin? He placed his hands \\nin his jacket pockets and hunched up his shoulders.\\n\\nUsually he did not bother guiding himself consciously. His body knew the way perfectly \\nfrom his offices to his computer room and from there to his apartment and back. \\nGenerally he negotiated the path with his thoughts elsewhere, but today a sound \\npenetrated his consciousness. A sound without meaning.\\n\\n“Jo . . . Jo . . . Jo . . . Jo . . .”\\n\\nIt was rather soft and distant, but it brought back a memory. Yes, Amaryl’s warning. The \\ndemagogue. Was he here on campus?\\n\\nHis legs swerved without Seldon’s making a conscious decision and brought him over \\nthe low rise to the University Field, which was used for calisthenics, sports, and student \\noratory.\\n\\nIn the middle of the Field was a moderate-sized crowd of students who were chanting \\nenthusiastically. On a platform was someone he didn’t recognize, someone with a loud \\nvoice and a swaying rhythm.\\n\\nIt wasn’t this man, Joranum, however. He had seen Joranum on holovision a number of \\ntimes. Since Amaryl’s warning, Seldon had paid close attention. Joranum was large and \\nsmiled with a kind of vicious camaraderie. He had thick sandy hair and light blue eyes.\\n\\nThis speaker was small, if anything--thin, wide-mouthed, dark-haired, and loud. Seldon \\nwasn’t listening to the words, though he did hear the phrase “power from the one to the \\nmany” and the many-voiced shout in response.\\n\\nFine, thought Seldon, but just how does he intend to bring this about --and is he serious?\\n\\n',\n",
              " 'He was at the outskirts of the crowd now and looked around far someone he knew. He \\nspotted Finangelos, a pret-math undergraduate. Not a bad young man, dark and woolly-\\nhaired.\\n\\n“Finangelos,” he called out.\\n\\n“Professor Seldon” said Finangelos after a moment of staring as though unable to \\nrecognize Seldon without a keyboard at his fingertips he trotted over. “Did you come to \\nlisten to this guy?”\\n\\n“I didn’t come for any purpose but to find out what the noise was. Who is he?”\\n\\n“His name is Namarti, Professor. He’s speaking for Jo-Jo.”\\n\\n“I hearthat , “ said Seldon as he listened to the chant again. It began each time the \\nspeaker made a telling point, apparently. “But who is this Namarti? I don’t recognize the \\nname. What department is he in?”\\n\\n“He’s not a member of the University, Professor. He’s one of Jo-Jo’s men.”\\n\\n“If he’s not a member of the University, he has no right to speak here without a permit. \\nDoes he have one, do you suppose?”\\n\\n“I wouldn’t know, Professor.”\\n\\n“Well then, let’s find out.”\\n\\nSeldon started into the crowd, but Finangelos caught his sleeve. “Don’t start anything, \\nProfessor. He’s got goons with him.”\\n\\nThere were six young men behind the speaker, spaced rather widely, legs apart, arms \\nfolded, scowling.\\n\\n“Goons?”\\n\\n“For rough stuff, in case anyone tries anything funny.”\\n\\n“Then he’s certainly not a member of the University and even a permit wouldn’t cover \\nwhat you call his ‘goons’. --Finangelos, signal through to the University security \\nofficers.

It wasn’t difficult. Some of those present recognized \\nhim and all could see the professorial shoulder patch. He reached the platform, placed \\nhis hands on it, and vaulted up the three feet with a small grunt. He thought, with \\nchagrin, that he could have done it with one hand ten years before and without the grunt.\\n\\nHe straightened up. The speaker had stopped talking and was looking at him with wary \\nand ice-hard eyes.\\n\\nSeldon said calmly, “Your permit to address the students, sir.”\\n\\n“Who are you?” said the speaker. He said it loudly, his voice carrying.\\n\\n“I’m a member of the faculty of this University,” said Seldon, equally loudly. “Your \\npermit, sir?”\\n\\n“I deny your right to question me on the matter.” The young men behind the speaker had \\ngathered closer.\\n\\n“If you have none, I would advise you to leave the University grounds immediately.”\\n\\n“And if I don’t?”\\n\\n“Well, for one thing, the University security officers are on their way.” He turned to the \\ncrowd. “Students,” he called out, “we have the right of free speech and freedom of \\nassembly on this campus, but it can be taken away from us if we allow outsiders, \\nwithout permits, to make unauthorized--”\\n\\nA heavy hand fell on his shoulder and he winced.

That doesn’t scare us.”\\n\\n',\n",
              " '“Of course it wouldn’t,” said Seldon. “You’d like it, but there won’t be a riot. You’ll all \\ngo quietly.” He turned again to the students and shrugged off the hand on his shoulder. \\n“We’ll see to that, won’t we?”\\n\\nSomeone in the crowd shouted, “That’s Professor Seldon! He’s all right! Don’t pound \\nhim!”\\n\\nSeldon sensed ambivalence in the crowd. There would be some, he knew, who would \\nwelcome a dust-up with the University security officers, just on general principles. On \\nthe other hand, there had to be some who liked him personally and still others who did \\nnot know him but who would not want to see violence against a member of the faculty.\\n\\nA woman’s voice rang out. “Watch out, Professor!”\\n\\nSeldon sighed and regarded the large young men he faced. He didn’t know if he could \\ndo it, if his reflexes were quick enough, his muscles sturdy enough, even given his \\nprowess at Twisting.\\n\\nOne goon was approaching him, overconfidently of course. Not quickly, which gave \\nSeldon a little of the time his aging body would need. The goon held out his arm \\nconfrontationally, which made it easier.\\n\\nSeldon seized the arm, whirled, and bent, arm up, and then down (with a grunt why did \\nhe have to grunt?), and the goon went flying through the air, propelled partly by his own \\nmomentum. He landed with athump on the outer edge of the platform, his right shoulder \\ndislocated.\\n\\nThere was a wild cry from the audience at this totally unexpected development. Instantly \\nan institutional pride erupted.\\n\\n“Take them, Prof!” a lone voice shouted. Others took up the cry.\\n\\nSeldon smoothed back his hair, trying not to puff. With his foot he shoved the groaning \\nfallen goon off the platform.\\n\\n“Anyone else?” he asked pleasantly. “Or will you leave quietly?”\\n\\nHe faced Namarti and his five henchmen and as they paused irresolutely, Seldon said, “I \\nwarn you. The crowd is on my side now. If you try to rush me, they’ll take you apart. --\\nOkay, who’s next? Let’s go. One at a time.”\\n\\nHe had raised his voice with the last sentence and made small come-hither motions with \\n\\n',\n",

One at \\na time!” and getting between the bodyguards and Seldon.\\n\\nSeldon increased the pressure on the other’s windpipe and whispered in his ear, “There’s \\na way to do this, Namarti, and I know how: I’ve practiced it for years. If you make a \\nmove and try to break away, I’ll ruin your larynx so that you’ll never talk above a \\nwhisper again. If you value your voice, do as I say. When I let up, you tell your bunch of \\nbullies to leave. If you say anything else, they’ll be the last words you’ll say normally. \\nAnd if you ever come back to this campus again, no more Mr. Nice Guy. I’ll finish the \\njob.”\\n\\nHe released the pressure momentarily. Namarti said huskily, “All of you. Get out.” They \\nretreated rapidly, helping their stricken comrade.\\n\\nWhen the University security officers arrived a few moments later, Seldon said, “Sorry, \\ngentlemen. False alarm.”\\n\\nHe left the Field and resumed his walk home with more than a little chagrin. He had \\nrevealed a side of himself he did not want to reveal. He was Hari Seldon, mathematician, \\nnot Hari Seldon, sadistic twister.\\n\\nBesides, he thought gloomily, Dors would hear of this.

There were many \\nworlds, even many sectors on Trantor where it would have been common to call her \\nDors Seldon, but that, he always thought, would put the mark of ownership on her and \\nhe did not wish it, even though the custom was sanctioned by existence back into the \\nvague mists of the pre-Imperial past.\\n\\nDors said, softly and with a sad shake of her head that barely disturbed her loose curls, \\n“I’ve heard, Hari. Justwhat am I going to do with you?”\\n\\n“A kiss would not be amiss.”\\n\\n“Well, perhaps, but only after we probe this a little. Come in.” The door closed behind \\nthem. “You know, dear, I have my course and my research.

I sent Raych out looking for you. After all, you were late and I was \\nconcerned. You usually tell me when you’re going to be late. I’m sorry if that makes me \\nsound as though I’m your keeper, Hari, but I am your keeper.”\\n\\n“Does it occur to you, Keeper Dors, that every once in a while I like to slip my leash?”\\n\\n“And if something happens to you, what do I tell Demerzel?”\\n\\n“Am I too late for dinner? Have we clicked for kitchen service?”\\n\\n“No. I was waiting for you. And as long as you’re here, you click it. You’re a great deal \\npickier than I am when it comes to food. And don’t change the subject.”\\n\\n“Didn’t Raych tell you that I was all right? So what’s there to talk about?”\\n\\n“When he found you, you were in control of the situation and he got back here first, but \\nnot by much. I didn’t hear any details. Tell me--What--were--you--doing?”\\n\\nSeldon shrugged. “There was an illegal gathering, Dors, and I broke it up.

To test your status at forty?”\\n\\nSeldon thoughtfully clicked the dinner menu. Then he said, “No. I really was concerned \\nthat the University would get into needless trouble. And I was concerned about \\nDemerzel. I’m afraid that Yugo’s tales of danger had impressed me more than I realized. \\nThat was stupid, Dors, because I know that Demerzel can take care of himself. I couldn’t \\nexplain that to Yugo or to anyone but you.”\\n\\nHe drew in a deep breath. “It’s amazing what a pleasure it is that I can at least talk to \\nyou about it.

If it hadn’t been for Eto Demerzel--a robot--Hari would never \\nhave met Dors. For Dorsworked for Demerzel; it was Demerzel who “assigned” Dors to \\nHari’s case eight years ago to protect him during his flight throughout the various sectors \\nof Trantor. Even though now she was his wife, his help-meet, his “‘better half,” Hari still \\noccasionally wondered about Dors’s strange connection with the robot Demerzel. It was \\nthe only area of Dors’s life where Hari truly felt he did not belong--nor welcome.

He wanted to believe \\nthe latter--and yet . . .\\n\\nHis life with Dors Venabili was a happy one, but it was so at a cost, at a condition. The \\ncondition was all the more stringent, in that it had been settled not through discussion or \\nagreement but by a mutual unspoken understanding.\\n\\nSeldon understood that he found in Dors everything he would have wanted in a wife. \\nTrue, he had no children, but he had neither expected any, nor, to tell the truth, had \\ngreatly wanted any. He had Raych, who was as much a son of his emotionally as if he \\nhad inherited the entire Seldonian genome--perhaps more so.\\n\\nThe mere fact that Dors was causing him to think about the matter was breaking the \\nagreement that had kept them in peace and comfort all these years and he felt a faint but \\ngrowing resentment at that.\\n\\nBut he pushed those thoughts, the questions, away again. He had learned to accept her \\nrole as his protector and would continue to do so. After all, it was he with whom she \\nshared a home, a table, and a bed--not Eto Demerzel.\\n\\nDors’s voice brought him out of his reverie.\\n\\n“I said-- Are you sulking, Hari?”\\n\\nHe started slightly, for there was the sound of repetition in her voice, and he realized he \\nhad been shrinking steadily deeper into his mind and away from her.\\n\\n“I’m sorry, dear. I’m not sulking. --Not deliberately sulking. I’m just wondering how I \\nought to respond to your statement.”\\n\\n“About robots?” She seemed quite calm as she said the word.\\n\\n',\n",
              " '“You said I don’t know as much about them as you do. How do I respond to that?” He \\npaused, then added quietly (knowing he was taking a chance), “That is, without \\noffense.”\\n\\n“I didn’t say you didn’tknow about robots. If you’re going to quote me, do so with \\nprecision. I said you didn’tunderstand about robots. I’m sure that you know a great deal, \\nperhaps more than I do, but to know is not necessarily to understand.”\\n\\n“Now, Dors, you’re deliberately speaking in paradoxes to be annoying. A paradox arises \\nonly out of an ambiguity that deceives either unwittingly or by design. I don’t like that \\nin science and I don’t like it in casual conversation, either, unless it is meant \\nhumorously, which I think is not the case now.”\\n\\nDors laughed in her particular way, softly, almost as though amusement were too \\nprecious to be shared in an overliberal manner. “Apparently the paradox has annoyed \\nyou into pomposity and you are always humorous when you are pompous. However, I’ll \\nexplain. It’s not my intention to annoy you.” She reached over to pat his hand and it was \\nto Seldon’s surprise (and slight embarrassment) that he found that he had clenched his \\nhand into a fist.\\n\\nDors said, “You talk about psychohistory a great deal. To me, at any rate. You know \\nthat?”\\n\\nSeldon cleared his throat. “I throw myself on your mercy as far as that’s concerned. The \\nproject is secret--by its very nature. Psychohistory won’t work unless the people it \\naffects know nothing about it, so I can talk about it only to Yugo and to you. To Yugo, it \\nis all intuition. He’s brilliant, but he is so apt to leap wildly into darkness that I must play \\nthe role of caution, of forever pulling him back. But I have my wild thoughts, too, and it \\nhelps me to be able to hear them aloud, even”--and he smiled-- “when I have a pretty \\ngood notion that you don’t understand a word I’m saying.”\\n\\n“I know I’m your sounding board and I don’t mind. --Ireally don’t mind, Hari, so don’t \\nbegin making inner resolutions to change your behavior. Naturally I don’t understand \\nyour mathematics. I’m just a historian--and not even a historian of science. The \\ninfluence of economic change on political development is what is taking up my time \\nnow--”\\n\\n“Yes, and I’myour sounding board on that or hadn’t you noticed? I’ll need it for \\npsychohistory when the time comes, so I suspect you’ll be an indispensable help to me.”\\n\\n“Good! Now that we’ve settled why you stay with me--I knew it couldn’t be for my \\nethereal beauty--let me go on to explain that occasionally, when your discussion veers \\n\\n',\n",
              " 'away from the strictly mathematical aspects, it seems to me that I get your drift. You \\nhave, on a number of occasions, explained what you call the necessity of minimalism. I \\nthink I understand that. By it, you mean--”\\n\\n“I know what I mean.”\\n\\nDors looked hurt. “Less lofty, please, Hari. I’m not trying to explain to you. I want to \\nexplain it to myself. You say you’re my sounding board, so act like one. Turnabout is \\nfair play, isn’t it?”\\n\\n“Turnabout is fine, but if you’re going to accuse me of loftiness when I say one little--”\\n\\n‘‘Enough! Shut up! --You have told me that minimalism is of the highest importance in \\napplied psychohistory; in the art of attempting to change an undesired development into \\na desired one or, at any rate, a toss undesired one. You have said that a change must be \\napplied that is as minute, as minimal, as possible--”\\n\\n“Yes,” said Seldon eagerly, “that is because--”\\n\\n“No, Hari.I’m trying to explain. We both know thatyou understand it. You must have \\nminimalism because every change, any change, has a myriad of side effects that can’t \\nalways be allowed for. If the change is side effects too many, then it becomes certain that \\nthe outcome will be far removed from anything you’ve planned and that it would be \\nentirely unpredictable.”\\n\\n“Right,” said Seldon. “That’s the essence of a chaotic effect. The problem is whether any \\nchange is small enough to make the consequence reasonably predictable or whether \\nhuman history is inevitably and unalterably chaotic in every respect. It was that which, \\nat the start, made me think that psychohistory was not--”\\n\\n“I know, but you’re not letting me make my point. Whether any change would be small \\nenough is not the issue. The point is that any change greater than the minimal is chaotic. \\nThe required minimum may be zero, but if it is not zero, then it is still very small--and it \\nwould be a major problem to find some change that is small enough and yet is \\nsignificantly greater than zero. Now, that, I gather, is what you mean by the necessity of \\nminimalism.”\\n\\n“More or less,” said Seldon. “Of course, as always, the matter is expressed more \\ncompactly and more rigorously in the language of mathematics. See here--”\\n\\n“Save me,” said Dors. “Since you know this about psychohistory, Hari, you ought to \\nknow it about Demerzel, too. You have the knowledge but not the understanding, \\n\\n',\n",
              " 'because it apparently doesn’t occur to you to apply the rules of psychohistory to the \\nLaws of Robotics.”\\n\\nTo which Seldon replied faintly, “Now Idon’t see what you’re getting at.\\n\\n“He requires minimality, too, doesn’t he, Hari? By the First Law of Robotics, a robot \\ncan’t harm a human being. That is the prime rule for the usual robot, but Demerzel is \\nsomething quite unusual and for him, the Zeroth Law is a reality and it takes precedence \\neven over the First Law. The Zeroth Law states that a robot can’t harm humanity as a \\nwhole. But that puts Demerzel into the same bind in which you exist when you labor at \\npsychohistory. Do you see?”\\n\\n“I’m beginning to.”\\n\\n“I hope so. If Demerzel has the ability to change minds, he has to do so without bringing \\nabout side effects he does not wish--and since he is the Emperor’s First Minister, the \\nside effects he must worry about are numerous, indeed.”\\n\\n“And the application to the present case?”\\n\\n“Think about it! You can’t tell anyone--except me, of course--that Demerzel is a robot, \\nbecause he has adjusted you so that you can’t. But how much adjustment did that take? \\nDo you want to tell people that he is a robot? Do you want to ruin his effectiveness when \\nyou depend on him for protection, for support of your grants, for influence quietly \\nexerted on your behalf? Of course not. The change he had to make then was a very tiny \\none, just enough to keep you from blurting it out in a moment of excitement or \\ncarelessness. It is so small a change that there are no particular side effects. That is how \\nDemerzel tries to run the Empire generally.”\\n\\n“And the case of Joranum?”\\n\\n“Is obviously completely different from yours. He is, for whatever motives, unalterably \\nopposed to Demerzel. Undoubtedly, Demerzel could change that, but it would be at the \\nprice of introducing a considerable wrench in Joranum’s makeup that would bring about \\nresults Demerzel could not predict. Rather than take the chance of harming Joranum, of \\nproducing side effects that would harm others and, possibly, all of humanity, he must \\nleave Joranum alone until he can find some small change--somesmall change--that will \\nsave the situation without harm. That is why Yugo is right and why Demerzel is \\nvulnerable.”\\n\\nSeldon had listened but did not respond. He seemed lost in thought. Minutes passed \\nbefore he said, “If Demerzel can do nothing in this matter, then I must.”\\n\\n',\n",
              " '“If he can do nothing, what can you do?”\\n\\n“The case is different. I am not bound by the Laws of Robotics. I need not concern \\nmyself obsessively with minimalism. --and to begin with, I must see Demerzel.”\\n\\nDors looked faintly anxious. “Must you? Surely it wouldn’t be wise to advertise a \\nconnection between the two of you.”\\n\\n“We have reached a time where we can’t make a fetish of pretending there is no \\nconnection. Naturally I won’t go to see him behind a flourish of trumpets and an \\nannouncement on holovision, but I must see him.”\\n\\n  \\n\\n 5\\n\\n  \\n\\n      Seldon found himself raging at the passage of time. Eight years ago, when he had \\nfirst arrived on Trantor, he could take instant action. He had only a hotel room and its \\ncontents to forsake and he could range through the sectors of Trantor at will.\\n\\nNow he found himself with department meetings, with decisions to make, with work to \\ndo. It was not so easy to dash off at will to see Demerzel--and if he could, Demerzel also \\nhad a --full schedule of his own. To find a time when they both could meet would not be \\neasy.\\n\\nNor was it easy to have Dors shake her head at him. “I don’t know what you intend to \\ndo, Hari.”\\n\\nAnd he answered impatiently, “I don’t know what I intend to do, either, Dors. I hope to \\nfind out when I see Demerzel.”\\n\\n“Your first duty is to psychohistory. He’ll tell you so.”\\n\\n“Perhaps. I’ll find out.”\\n\\nAnd then, just as he had arranged a time for the meeting with the First Minister, eight \\ndays hence, he received a message on his department office wall screen in slightly \\narchaic lettering. And to match that was the more than slightly archaic message: I \\nCRAVE AN AUDIENCE WITH PROFESSOR HARI SELDON.\\n\\n',\n",
              " 'Seldon stared at it with astonishment. Even the Emperor was not addressed in quite that \\ncenturies-old turn of phrase.\\n\\nNor was the signature printed as it usually was for clarity. It was scripted with a flourish \\nthat left it perfectly legible and yet gave it the aura of a careless work of art dashed off \\nby a master. The signature was: LASKIN JORANUM. --It was Jo-Jo himself, craving an \\naudience.\\n\\nSeldon found himself chuckling. It was clear why the choice of words --and why the \\nscript. It made what was a simple request a device for stimulating curiosity. Seldon had \\nno great desire to meet the man--or would have had none ordinarily. But what was worth \\nthe archaism and the artistry? He wanted to find out.\\n\\nHe had his secretary set the time and the place of the appointment. It would be in his \\noffice, certainly not in his apartment. A business conversation, nothing social.\\n\\nAnd it would come before the projected meeting with Demerzel.\\n\\nDors said, “It’s no surprise to me, Hari. You hurt two of his people, one of them his chief \\naide; you spoiled a little rally he was holding; and you made him, in the person of his \\nrepresentatives, seem foolish. He wants to take a look at you and I think I had better be \\nwith you.”\\n\\nSeldon shook his head. “I’ll take Raych. He knows all the tricks I know and he’s a \\nstrong and active twenty-year-old. Although I’m sure there’ll be no need for protection.”\\n\\n“How can you be sure?”\\n\\n“Joranum is coming to see me on the University grounds. There will be any number of \\nyoungsters in the vicinity. I’m not exactly an unpopular figure with the student body and \\nI suspect that Joranum is the kind of man who does his homework and knows that I’ll be \\nsafe on home territory. I’m sure that he will be perfectly polite--completely friendly.”\\n\\n“Hmph,” said Dors with a light twist of one corner of her lip.\\n\\n“And quite deadly,” Seldon finished.\\n\\n  \\n\\n 6\\n\\n',\n",

He had taken the trouble to look up a variety of holographs \\nof Joranum, but, as is often the case, the real thing, unguarded, shifting constantly in \\nresponse to changing conditions, is never quite the same as a holograph--however \\ncarefully prepared. Perhaps, thought Seldon, it is the response of the viewer to the “real \\nthing” that makes it different.\\n\\nJoranum was a tall man--as tall as Seldon, at any rate--but larger in other directions. It \\nwas not due to a muscular physique, for he gave the impression of softness, without \\nquite being fat. A rounded face, a thick head of hair that was sandy rather than yellow, \\nlight blue eyes. He wore a subdued coverall and his face bore a half-smile that gave the \\nillusion of friendliness, while making it clear, somehow, that it was only an illusion.\\n\\n“Professor Seldon”--his voice was deep and under strict control, an orator’s voice--”I am \\ndelighted to meet you. It is kind of you to permit this meeting. I trust you are not \\noffended that I have brought a companion, my right-hand man, with me, although I have \\nnot cleared that with you in advance. He is Gambol Deen Namarti--three names, you \\nnotice. I believe you have met him.”\\n\\n“Yes, I have. I remember the incident well.” Seldon looked at Namarti with a touch of \\nthe sardonic. At the previous encounter, Namarti had been speaking at the University \\nField. Seldon viewed him carefully now--under relaxed conditions. Namarti was of \\nmoderate height, with a thin face, sallow complexion, dark hair, and a wide mouth. He \\ndid not have Joranum’s half-smile or any noticeable expression--except for a sense of \\ncautious wariness.\\n\\n“My friend Dr. Namarti--his degree is in ancient literature--has come at his own \\nrequest,” said Joranum, his smile intensifying a bit, “to apologize.”\\n\\nJoranum glanced quickly at Namarti--and Namarti, his lips tightening just at first, said in \\na colorless voice, “I am sorry, Professor, for what happened at the Field. I was not quite \\naware of the strict rules governing University rallies and I was a little carried away by \\nmy own enthusiasm.”\\n\\n“Understandably so,” said Joranum. “Nor was he entirely aware of your identity. I think \\nwe may all now forget the matter.”\\n\\n“I assure you, gentlemen,” said Seldon, “that I have no great desire to remember it. This \\nis my son, Raych Seldon, so you see I have a companion, too.”\\n\\n',\n",
              " 'Raych had grown a mustache, black and abundant--the masculine mark of the Dahlite. \\nHe had had none when he first met Seldon eight years before, when he was a street boy, \\nragged and hungry. He was short but lithe and sinewy and his expression was the \\nhaughty one he had adopted in order to add a few spiritual inches to his physical height.\\n\\n“Good morning, young man,” said Joranum.\\n\\n“Good morning, sir,” said Raych.\\n\\n“Please sit down, gentlemen,” said Seldon. “May I offer you something to eat or drink?”\\n\\nJoranum held up his hands in polite refusal. “No, sir. This is not a social call.” He seated \\nhimself in the place indicated. “Though I hope there will be many such calls in the \\nfuture.”\\n\\n“If this is to be about business, then let’s begin.”\\n\\n“The news reached me, Professor Seldon, of the little incident that you have so kindly \\nagreed to forget and I wondered why you took the chance of doing what you did. It was \\na risk, you must admit.”\\n\\n“I didn’t think so, actually.”\\n\\n“But I did. So I took the liberty of finding out everything I could about you, Professor \\nSeldon. You’re an interesting man. From Helicon, I discovered.”\\n\\n“Yes, that’s where I was born. The records are clear.”\\n\\n“And you’ve been here on Trantor for eight years.”\\n\\n“That is also a matter of public record.”\\n\\n“And you made yourself quite famous at the start by delivering a mathematical paper \\non--what do you call it?--psychohistory?”\\n\\nSeldon shook his head very slightly. How often he had regretted that indiscretion. Of \\ncourse, he had had no idea at the time that it was an indiscretion. He said, “A youthful \\nenthusiasm. It came to nothing.”\\n\\n“Is that so?” Joranum looked around him with an air of pleased surprise. “Yet here you \\nare, the head of the Mathematics Department at one of Trantor’s greatest Universities, \\nand only forty years old, I believe. --I’m forty-two, by the way, so I don’t look upon you \\n\\n',\n",
              " 'as very old at all. You must be a very competent mathematician to be in this position.”\\n\\nSeldon shrugged. “I wouldn’t care to make a judgment in that matter.”\\n\\n“Or you must have powerful friends.”\\n\\n“We would all like to have powerful friends, Mr. Joranum, but I think you will find none \\nhere. University professors rarely have powerful friends or, I sometimes think, friends of \\nany kind.” He smiled.\\n\\nAnd so did Joranum. “Wouldn’t you consider the Emperor a powerful friend, Professor \\nSeldon?”\\n\\n“I certainly would, but what has that to do with me?”\\n\\n“I am under the impression that the Emperor is a friend of yours.”\\n\\n“I’m sure the records will show, Mr. Joranum, that I had an audience with His Imperial \\nMajesty eight years ago. It lasted perhaps an hour or less and I saw no signs of any great \\nfriendliness in him at the time. Nor have I spoken to him since--or even seen him--\\nexcept on holovision, of course.”\\n\\n“But, Professor, it is not necessary to see or speak to the Emperor to have him as a \\npowerful friend. It is sufficient to see or speak to Eto Demerzel, the Emperor’s First \\nMinister. Demerzel is your protector and, since he is, we may as well say the Emperor \\nis.”\\n\\n“Do you find First Minister Demerzel’s supposed protection of me anywhere in the \\nrecords? Or anything at all in the records from which you can deduce that protection?”\\n\\n“Why search the records when it is well known that there is a connection between the \\ntwo of you. You know it and I know it. Let us take it then as given and continue. And \\nplease”--he raised his hands--”do not take the trouble to give me any heartfelt denials. \\nIt’s a waste of time.”\\n\\n“Actually,” said Seldon, “I was going to ask why you should think that he would want to \\nprotect me. To what end?”\\n\\n“Professor? Are you trying to hurt me by pretending to think I am a monster of naivete? \\nI mentioned your psychohistory, which Demerzel wants.”\\n\\n“And I told you that it was a youthful indiscretion that came to nothing.”\\n\\n',\n",

They tell me it is a wild \\ndream and quite impossible--”\\n\\n“I quite agree with them,” said Seldon.\\n\\n“But I have the feeling that Demerzel is waiting for it to be developed and put to use. \\nAnd if he can wait, so can I. It would be more useful to you, Professor Seldon, to have \\nme wait.”\\n\\n“Why so?”\\n\\n“Because Demerzel will not endure in his position for much longer. Public opinion is \\nturning against him steadily. It may be that when the Emperor wearies of an unpopular \\nFirst Minister who threatens to drag the throne down with him, he will find a \\nreplacement. It may even be my poor self whom the Emperor’s fancy will seize upon. \\nAnd you will still need a protector, someone who can see to it that you can work in \\npeace and with ample funds for whatever you need in the way of equipment and \\nassistants.”\\n\\n“And would you be that protector?”\\n\\n“Of course--and for the same reason that Demerzel is. I want a successful psychohistoric \\ntechnique so that I can rule the Empire more efficiently.”\\n\\nSeldon nodded thoughtfully, waited a moment, then said, “But in that case, Mr. Joranum, \\nwhy must I concern myself in this? I am a poor scholar, living a quiet life, engaged in \\nout-of-the-way mathematical and pedagogical activities. You say that Demerzel is my \\npresent protector and that you will be my future protector. I can go quietly about my \\nbusiness, then. You and the First Minister may fight it out. Whoever prevails, I have a \\nprotector still--or, at least, so you tell me.”\\n\\nJoranum’s fixed smile seemed to fade a bit. Namarti, at his side, turned his dour face \\ntoward Joranum and made as though to say something, but Joranum’s hand moved \\nslightly and Namarti coughed and did not speak.\\n\\nJoranum said, “Dr. Seldon. Are you a patriot?”\\n\\n“Why, of course. The Empire has given humanity millennia of peace --mostly peace, at \\nany rate--and fostered steady advancement.”\\n\\n',\n",
              " '“So it has--but at a slower pace in the last century or two.”\\n\\nSeldon shrugged. “I have not studied such matters.”\\n\\n“You don’t have to. You know that, politically, the last century or two has been a time of \\nturmoil. Imperial reigns have been short and sometimes have been shortened further by \\nassassination--”\\n\\n“Even mentioning that,” put in Seldon, “is close to treason. I’d rather you didn’t--”\\n\\n“Well, there.” Joranum threw himself back in his seat. “See how insecure you are. The \\nEmpire is decaying. I’m willing to say so openly. Those who follow me do so because \\nthey know only too well it is. We need someone at the Emperor’s right hand who can \\ncontrol the Empire, subdue the rebellious impulses that seem to be arising everywhere, \\ngive the armed forces the natural leadership they should have, lead the economy--”\\n\\nSeldon made an impatient stopping motion with his arm. “And you’re the one to do it, \\nare you?”\\n\\n“I intend to be the one. It won’t be an easy job and I doubt there would be many \\nvolunteers--for good reason. Certainly Demerzel can’t do it. Under him, the decline of \\nthe Empire is accelerating to a total breakdown.”\\n\\n“But you can stop it?”\\n\\n“Yes, Dr. Seldon. With your help. With psychohistory.”\\n\\n“Perhaps Demerzel could stop the breakdown with psychohistory--if psychohistory \\nexisted.”\\n\\nJoranum said calmly, “It exists. Let us not pretend it does not. But its existence does not \\nhelp Demerzel. Psychohistory is only a tool. It needs a brain to understand it and an arm \\nto wield it.”\\n\\n“And you have those, I take it?”\\n\\n“Yes. I know my own virtues. I want psychohistory.”\\n\\nSeldon shook his head. “You may want it all you please. I don’t have it.\\n\\n“Youdo have it.

It had started from nothing three years \\nback and now its tentacles stretched--in some places more thickly than others, of \\ncourse--throughout Trantor. The Outer Worlds were as yet largely untouched. Demerzel \\nhad labored mightily to keep them content, but that washis mistake. It was here on \\nTrantor that rebellions were dangerous.

He had never once lost his \\nway except in minor matters, such as that recent rally at Streeling University in which \\nthis Seldon fellow had interfered.\\n\\nThat might be why Joranum had insisted on the interview with him. Even a minor toe \\nstub must be taken care of.

He was one of the very few people who could address \\nJoranum by the diminutive that the crowds shouted out endlessly in public.

But to be cut off suddenly and completely \\nmeans that the whole thing has been placed in the deepest of freezes. That is why \\nDemerzel may have been doing nothing to stop us. Perhaps he is not being guided by a \\nfoolish overconfidence; perhaps he is being guided by psychohistory, which must be \\npredicting something that Demerzel plans to take advantage of at the right time. If so, \\nwe might fail unless we can make use of psychohistory ourselves.”\\n\\n“Seldon claims it doesn’t exist.”\\n\\n“Wouldn’t you if you were he?”\\n\\n“I still say we ought to put pressure on him.”\\n\\n“It would be useless, G.D. Didn’t you ever hear the story of the Ax of Venn?”\\n\\n',\n",
              " '“No.”\\n\\n“You would if you were from Nishaya. It’s a famous folktale back home. In brief, Venn \\nwas a woodcutter who had a magic ax that, with a single light blow, could chop down \\nany tree. It was enormously valuable, but he never made any effort to hide it or preserve \\nit--and yet it was never stolen, because no one could lift or swing the ax but Venn \\nhimself.\\n\\n“Well, at the present moment, no one can handle psychohistory but Seldon himself. If he \\nwere on our side only because we had forced him, we could never be certain of his \\nloyalty. Might he not urge a course of action that would seem to work in our favor but \\nwould be so subtly drawn that, after a while, we found ourselves quite suddenly \\ndestroyed. No, he must come to our side voluntarily and labor for us because he wishes \\nus to win.”\\n\\n“But how can we bring him around?”\\n\\n“There’s Seldon’s son. Raych, I think he’s called. Did you observe him?”\\n\\n“Not particularly.”\\n\\n“G.D., G.D., you miss points if you don’t observe everything. That young man listened \\nto me with his heart in his eyes. He was impressed. I could tell. If there’s one thing I can \\ntell, it is just how I impress others. I know when I have shaken a mind, when I have \\nedged someone toward conversion.”\\n\\nJoranum smiled. It was not the pseudowarm ingratiating smile of his public demeanor. It \\nwas a genuine smile this time--cold, somehow, and menacing.\\n\\n“We’ll see what we can do with Raych,” he said, “and if, through him, we can reach \\nSeldon.”\\n\\n  \\n\\n 8\\n\\n  \\n\\n      Raych looked at Hari Seldon after the two politicians had gone and fingered his \\nmustache. It gave him satisfaction to stroke it. Here in the Streeling Sector, some men \\nwore mustaches, but they were usually thin despicable things of uncertain color--thin \\n\\n',\n",
              " 'despicable things, even if dark. Most men did not wear them at all and suffered with \\nnaked upper lips. Seldon didn’t, for instance, and that was just as well. With his color of \\nhair, a mustache would have been a travesty.\\n\\nHe watched Seldon closely, waiting for him to cease being lost in thought, and then \\nfound he could wait no longer.\\n\\nSeldon looked up and said, “What?” He sounded a little annoyed at having his thoughts \\ninterrupted, Raych decided.\\n\\nRaych said, “I don’t think it was right for you to see those two guys.”\\n\\n“Well, the thin guy, whatever his name is, was the guy you made trouble for at the Field. \\nHe can’t have liked it.”\\n\\n“Dad?” he said.\\n\\n“Oh? Why not?”\\n\\n“But he apologized.”\\n\\n“He didn’t mean it. But the other guy, Joranum--he can be dangerous. What if they had \\nhad weapons?”\\n\\n“What? Here in the University? In my office? Of course not. This isn’t Billibotton. \\nBesides, if they had tried anything, I could have handled both of them together. Easily.”\\n\\n“I don’t know, Dad,” said Raych dubiously. “You’re getting--”\\n\\n“Don’t say it, you ungrateful monster,” said Seldon, lifting an admonishing finger. \\n‘You’ll sound just like your mother and I have enough of that from her. I amnot getting \\nold--or, at least, notthat old. Besides, you were with me and you’re almost as skilled a \\nTwister as I am.”\\n\\nRaych’s nose wrinkled. “Twisting ain’t much good.” (It was no use. Raych heard \\nhimself speak and knew that, even eight years out of the morass of Dahl, he still slipped \\ninto using the Dahlite accent that marked him firmly as a member of the lower class. \\nAnd he was short, too, to the point where he sometimes felt stunted. --but he had his \\nmustache and no one ever patronized him twice.)\\n\\nHe said, “What are you going to do about Joranum?”\\n\\n',\n",
              " '“For now, nothing.”\\n\\n“Well, look, Dad, I saw Joranum on TrantorVision a couple of times. I even made some \\nholotapes of his speeches. --Everyone is talking about him, so I thought I would see \\nwhat he has to say. And, you know, he makes some kind of sense. I don’t like him and I \\ndon’t trust him, but hedoes make some kind of sense. He wants all sectors to have equal \\nrights and equal opportunities--and there ain’t nothing wrong with that, is there?”\\n\\n“Certainly not. All civilized people feel that way.”\\n\\n“So why don’t wehave that sort of stuff? Does the Emperor feel that way? Does \\nDemerzel?”\\n\\n“The Emperor and the First Minister have an entire Empire to worry about. They can’t \\nconcentrate all their efforts on Trantor itself. It’s easy for Joranum to talk about equality. \\nHe has no responsibilities. If he were in the position to rule, he would find that his \\nefforts would be greatly diluted by an Empire of twenty-five million planets. Not only \\nthat, but he would find himself stopped at every point by the sectors themselves. Each \\none wants a great deal of equality for itself--but not much equality for others. Tell me, \\nRaych, are you of the opinion that Joranum ought to have a chance to rule, just to show \\nwhat he can do?”\\n\\nRaych shrugged. “I don’t know. I wonder. --but if he had tried anything on you, I would \\nhave been at his throat before he could move two centimeters.”\\n\\n“Your loyalty to me, then, exceeds your concern for the Empire.”\\n\\n“Sure. You’re my dad.”\\n\\nSeldon looked at Raych fondly, but behind that look he felt a trace of uncertainty. How \\nfar could Joranum’s nearly hypnotic influence go?\\n\\n  \\n\\n 9\\n\\n  \\n\\n      Hari Seldon sat back in his chair, the vertical back giving as he did so and allowing \\nhim to assume a half-reclining position.

              " 'Dors Venabili was at the other end of the room, with her viewer turned off and the \\nmicrofilms back in place. She had been through a rather concentrated period of revision \\nof her opinions on the Florina Incident in early Trantorian history and she found it rather \\nrestful to withdraw for a few moments and to speculate on what it was that Seldon was \\nconsidering.\\n\\nIt had to be psychohistory. It would probably take him the rest of his life, tracking down \\nthe byways of this semichaotic technique, and he would end with it incomplete, leaving \\nthe task to others (to Amaryl, if that young man had not also worn himself out on the \\nmatter) and breaking his heart at the need to do that.\\n\\nYet it gave him a reason for living. He would live longer with the problem filling him \\nfrom end to end--and that pleased her. Someday she would lose him, she knew, and she \\nfound that the thought afflicted her. It had not seemed it would at the start, when her task \\nhad been the simple one of protecting him for the sake of what he knew.\\n\\nWhen had it become a matter of personal need? How could there be so personal a need? \\nWhat was there about the man that caused her to feel uneasy when he was not in her \\nsight, even when she knew he was safe so that the deeply ingrained orders within her \\nwere not called into action? His safety was all that she had been ordered to be concerned \\nwith. How did the rest intrude itself?\\n\\nShe had spoken of it to Demerzel long before, when the feeling had made itself \\nunmistakable.\\n\\nHe had regarded her gravely and said, ‘’You are complex, Dors, and there are no simple \\nanswers. In my life there have been several individuals whose presence made it easier \\nfor me to think, pleasanter to make my responses. I have tried to judge the ease of my \\nresponses in their presence and the unease of my responses in their final absence to see \\nwhether I was the net gainer or loser. In the process, one thing became plain. The \\npleasantness of their company outweighed the regret of their passing. On the whole, \\nthen, it is better to experience what you experience now than not to.”\\n\\nShe thought: Hari will someday leave a void, and each day that someday is closer, and I \\nmust not think of it.\\n\\nIt was to rid herself of the thought that she finally interrupted him. “What are you \\nthinking of, Hari?”\\n\\n“What?” Seldon focused his eyes with an apparent effort.\\n\\n“Psychohistory, I assume. I imagine you’ve traced another blind pathway.”\\n\\n',\n",
              " '“Well now. That’s not on my mind at all.” He laughed suddenly. “Do you want to know \\nwhat I’m thinking of? --Hair!”\\n\\n“Hair? Whose?”\\n\\n“Right now, yours.” He was looking at her fondly.\\n\\n“Is there something wrong with it? Should I dye it another color? Or perhaps, after all \\nthese years, it should go gray.”\\n\\n“Come! Who needs or wants gray inyour hair. --but it’s led me to other things. Nishaya, \\nfor instance.”\\n\\n“Nishaya? What’s that?”\\n\\n“It was never part of the pre-Imperial Kingdom of Trantor, so I’m not surprised you \\nhaven’t heard of it. It’s a world, a small one. Isolated. Unimportant. Overlooked. I only \\nknow anything at all about it because I’ve taken the trouble to look it up. Very few \\nworlds out of twenty-five million can really make much of a sustained splash, but I \\ndoubt that there’s another one as insignificant as Nishaya. Which is very significant, you \\nsee.”\\n\\nDors shoved her reference material to one side and said, “What is this new penchant you \\nhave for paradox, which you always tell me you detest? What is this significance of \\ninsignificance?”\\n\\n“Oh, I don’t mind paradoxes when I perpetrate them. You see, Joranum comes from \\nNishaya.”\\n\\n“Ah, it’s Joranum you’re concerned with.”\\n\\n“Yes. I’ve been viewing some of his speeches--at Raych’s insistence. They don’t make \\nvery much sense, but the total effect can be almost hypnotic. Raych is very impressed by \\nhim.”\\n\\n“I imagine that anyone of Dahlite origins would be, Hari. Joranum’s constant call for \\nsector equality would naturally appeal to the downtrodden heatsinkers. You remember \\nwhen we were in Dahl?”\\n\\n“I remember it very well and of course I don’t blame the lad. It just bothers me that \\nJoranum comes from Nishaya.”\\n\\n',\n",
              " 'Dors shrugged. “Well, Joranum has to come from somewhere and, conversely, Nishaya, \\nlike any other world, must send its people out at times, even to Trantor.”\\n\\n“Yes, but, as I’ve said, I’ve taken the trouble to investigate Nishaya. I’ve even managed \\nto make hyperspatial contact with some minor official which cost a considerable \\nquantity of credits that I cannot, in good conscience, charge to the department.”\\n\\n“And did you find anything that was worth the credits?”\\n\\n“I rather think so. You know, Joranum is always telling little stories to make his points, \\nstories that are legends on his home planet of Nishaya. That serves a good purpose for \\nhim here on Trantor, since it makes him appear to be a man of the people, full of \\nhomespun philosophy. Those tales litter his speeches. They make him appear to be from \\na small world, to have been brought up on an isolated farm surrounded by an untamed \\necology. People like it, especially Trantorians, who would rather die than be trapped \\nsomewhere in an untamed ecology but who love to dream about one just the same.”\\n\\n“But what of it all?”\\n\\n“The odd point is that not one of the stories was familiar to the person I spoke to on \\nNishaya.”\\n\\n“That’s not significant, Hari. It may be a small world, but it’s a world. What is current in \\nJoranum’s birth section of the world may not be current in whatever place your official \\ncame from.”\\n\\n“No no. Folktales, in one form or another, are usually worldwide. But aside from that, I \\nhad considerable trouble in understanding the fellow. He spoke Galactic Standard with a \\nthick accent. I spoke to a few others on the world, just to check, and they all had the \\nsame accent.”\\n\\n“And what of that?”\\n\\n“Joranum doesn’t have it. He speaks a fairly good Trantorian. It’s a lot better than mine, \\nactually. I have the Heliconian stress on the letter ‘r.’ He doesn’t. According to the \\nrecords, he arrived on Trantor when he was nineteen. It is just impossible, in my \\nopinion, to spend the first nineteen years of your life speaking that barbarous Nishayan \\nversion of Galactic Standard and then come to Trantor and lose it. However long he’s \\nbeen here, some trace of the accent would have remained-- Look at Raych and the way \\nhe lapses into his Dahlite way of speaking on occasion.”\\n\\n',\n",
              " '“What do you deduce from all this?”\\n\\n“What I deduce--what I’ve been sitting here all evening, deducing like a deduction \\nmachine--is that Joranum didn’t come from Nishaya at all. In fact, I think he picked \\nNishaya as the place to pretend to come from, simply because it is so backwoodsy, so \\nout-of-the-way, that no one would think of checking it. He must have made a thorough \\ncomputer search to find the one world least likely to allow him to be caught in a lie.”\\n\\n“But that’s ridiculous, Hari. Why should he want to pretend to be from a world he did \\nnot come from? It would mean a great deal of falsification of records.”\\n\\n“And that’s precisely what he has probably done. He probably has enough followers in \\nthe civil service to make that possible. Probably no one person has done as much in the \\nway of revision and all of his followers are too fanatical to talk about it.”\\n\\n“But still-- Why?”\\n\\n“Because I suspect Joranum doesn’t want people to know where he really comes from.”\\n\\n“Why not? All worlds in the Empire are equal, both by laws and by custom.”\\n\\n“I don’t know about that. These high-ideal theories are somehow never borne out in real \\nlife.”\\n\\n“Then where does he come from? Do you have any idea at all?”\\n\\n“Yes. Which brings us back to this matter of hair.”\\n\\n“What about hair?”\\n\\n“I sat there with Joranum, staring at him and feeling uneasy, without knowing why I was \\nfeeling uneasy. Then finally I realized that it was his hair that made me uneasy. There \\nwas something about it, a life, a gloss . . . aperfection to it that I’ve never seen before. \\nAnd then I knew. His hair is artificial and carefully grown on a scalp that ought to be \\ninnocent of such things.”\\n\\n“Oughtto be?” Dors’s eyes narrowed. It was clear that she suddenly understood. “Do \\nyou mean--”\\n\\n“Yes, Ido mean. He’s from the past-centered, mythology-ridden Mycogen Sector of \\nTrantor. That’s what he’s been laboring to hide.”\\n\\n',\n",
              " '  \\n\\n  \\n\\n 10\\n\\n      Dors Venabili thought coolly about the matter. It was her only mode of thought--\\ncool. Not for her the hot flashes of emotion.\\n\\nShe closed her eyes to concentrate. It had been eight years since she and Hari had visited \\nMycogen and they hadn’t been there long. There had been little to admire there except \\nthe food.\\n\\nThe pictures arose. The harsh, puritanical, male-centered society; the emphasis on the \\npast; the removal of all body hair, a painful process deliberately self-imposed to make \\nthemselves different so that they would “know who they were”; their legends; their \\nmemories (or fancies) of a time when they ruled the Galaxy, when their lives were \\nprolonged, when robots existed.\\n\\nDors opened her eyes and said, “Why, Hari?”\\n\\n“Why what, dear?”\\n\\n“Why should he pretend not to be from Mycogen?”\\n\\nShe didn’t think he would remember Mycogen in greater detail than she; in fact, she \\nknew he wouldn’t, but his mind was better than hers--different, certainly. Hers was a \\nmind that only remembered and drew the obvious inferences in the fashion of a \\nmathematic line of deduction. He had a mind that leaped unexpectedly. Seldon liked to \\npretend that intuition was solely the province of his assistant, Yugo Amaryl, but Dors \\nwas not fooled by that. Seldon liked to pose as the unworldly mathematician who stared \\nat the world out of perpetually wondering eyes, but she was not fooled by that, either.\\n\\n“Why should he pretend not to be from Mycogen?” she repeated as he sat there, his eyes \\nlost in an inward look that Dors always associated with his attempt to squeeze one more \\ntiny drop of usefulness and validity out of the concepts of psycho-history.\\n\\nSeldon said finally, “It’s a harsh society, a limiting society. There are always those who \\nchafe over its manner of dictating every action and every thought. There are always \\nthose who find they cannot entirely be broken to the harness, who want the greater \\nliberties available in the more secular world outside. It’s understandable.”\\n\\n',\n",
              " '“So they force the growth of artificial hair?”\\n\\n“No, not generally. The average Breakaway--that’s what the Mycogenians call the \\ndeserters and they despise them, of course--wears a wig. It’s much simpler but much less \\neffective. Really serious Breakaways grow false hair, I’m told. The process is difficult \\nand expensive but is almost unnoticeable. I’ve never come across it before, though I’ve \\nheard of it. I’ve spent years studying all eight hundred sectors of Trantor, trying to work \\nout the basic rules and mathematics of psychohistory. I have little enough to show for it, \\nunfortunately, but I have learned a few things.”\\n\\n“But why, then, do the Breakaways have to hide the fact that they’re from Mycogen? \\nThey’re not persecuted that I know of.”\\n\\n“No, they’re not. In fact, there’s no general impression that Mycogenians are inferior. \\nIt’s worse than that. The Mycogenians aren’t taken seriously. They’re intelligent--\\neveryone admits that--highly educated, dignified, cultured, wizards with food, almost \\nfrightening in their capacity to keep their sector prosperous--but no one takes them \\nseriously. Their beliefs strike people outside Mycogen as ridiculous, humorous, \\nunbelievably foolish. And that view clings even to Mycogenians who are Breakaways. A \\nMycogenian attempt to seize power in the government would be crushed by laughter. \\nBeing feared is nothing. Being despised, even, can be lived with. But being laughed at--\\nthat’s fatal. Joranum wants to be First Minister, so he must have hair, and, to be \\ncomfortable, he must represent himself as having been brought up on some obscure \\nworld as far from Mycogen as he can possibly manage.”\\n\\n“Surely there are some people who are naturally bald.”\\n\\n“Never as completely depilated as Mycogenians force themselves to be. On the Outer \\nWorlds, it wouldn’t matter much. But Mycogen is a distant whisper to the Outer Worlds. \\nThe Mycogenians keep themselves so much to themselves that it is a rare one, indeed, \\nwho has ever left Trantor. Here on Trantor, though, it’s different. People might be bald, \\nbut they usually have a fringe of hair that advertises them as nonMycogenian--or they \\ngrow facial hair. Those very few who are completely hairless--usually a pathological \\ncondition--are out of luck. I imagine they have to go around with a doctor’s certificate to \\nprove they are not Mycogenians.”\\n\\nDors, frowning slightly, said, “Does this help us any?”\\n\\n“I’m not sure.”\\n\\n“Couldn’t you let it be known that he is a Mycegonian?”\\n\\n',\n",
              " '“I’m not sure that could be done easily. He must have covered his tracks well and even if \\nit could be done--”\\n\\n“Yes?”\\n\\nSeldon shrugged. “I don’t want to invite an appeal to bigotry. The social situation on \\nTrantor is bad enough without running the risk of loosing passions that neither I nor \\nanyone else could then control. If I do have to resort to the matter of Mycogen, it will \\nonly be as a last resort.”\\n\\n“Then you want minimalism, too.”\\n\\n“Of course.”\\n\\n“Then whatwill you do?”\\n\\n“I made an appointment with Demerzel. He may know what to do.”\\n\\nDors looked at him sharply. “Hari, are you falling into the trap of expecting Demerzel to \\nsolve every problem for you?”\\n\\n“No, but perhaps he’ll solve this one.”\\n\\n“And if he doesn’t?”\\n\\n“Then I’ll have to think of something else, won’t I?”\\n\\n“Like what?”\\n\\nA look of pain crossed Seldon’s face. “Dors, I don’t know. Don’t expectme to solve \\nevery problem, either.”\\n\\n 11\\n\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\n      Eto Demerzel was not frequently seen, except by the Emperor Cleon. It was his \\npolicy to remain in the background for a variety of reasons, one of which was that his \\nappearance changed so little with time.\\n\\n',\n",
              " 'Hari Seldon had not seen him over a period of some years and had not spoken to him \\ntruly in private since the days of his early time on Trantor.\\n\\nIn light of Seldon’s recent unsettling meeting with Laskin Joranum, both Seldon and \\nDemerzel felt it would be best not to advertise their relationship. A visit by Hari Seldon \\nto the First Minister’s office at the Imperial Palace would not go unnoticed, and so for \\nreasons of security they had decided to meet in a small yet luxuriously appointed suite at \\nthe Dome’s Edge Hotel, just outside the Palace grounds.\\n\\nSeeing Demerzel now brought back the old days achingly. The mere fact that Demerzel \\nstill looked exactly as he always had made the ache sharper. His face still had its strong \\nregular features. He was still tall and sturdy-looking, with the same dark hair with the \\nhint of blond. He was not handsome, but was gravely distinguished. He looked like \\nsomeone’s ideal picture of what an Imperial First Minister ought to look like, not at all \\nlike any such official in history before his time ever had. It was his appearance, Seldon \\nthought, that gave him half his power over the Emperor, and therefore over the Imperial \\nCourt, and therefore over the Empire.\\n\\nDemerzel advanced toward him, a gentle smile curving his lips without altering in any \\nway the gravity of his countenance.\\n\\n“Hart,” he said. “It is pleasant to see you. I was half-afraid you would change your mind \\nand cancel.”\\n\\n“I was more than half-afraidyou would, First Minister.”\\n\\n“Eto--if you fear using my real name.”\\n\\n“I couldn’t. It won’t come out of me. You know that.”\\n\\n“It will to me. Say it. I would rather like to hear it.”\\n\\nSeldon hesitated, as though he couldn’t believe his lips could frame the words or his \\nvocal cords sound them. “Daneel,” he said at length.\\n\\n“R. Daneel Olivaw,” said Demerzel. “Yes. You will dine with me, Hari. If I dine with \\nyou, I won’t have to eat, which will be a relief.”\\n\\n“Gladly, though one-way eating is not my idea of a convivial time. Surely a bite or \\ntwo--”\\n\\n“To please you--”\\n\\n',\n",
              " '“Just the same,” said Seldon, “I can’t help but wonder if it is wise to spend too much \\ntime together.”\\n\\n“It is. Imperial orders. His Imperial Majesty wants me to.”\\n\\n“Why, Daneel?”\\n\\n“In two more years the Decennial Convention will be meeting again. --You look \\nsurprised. Have you forgotten?”\\n\\n“Not really. I just haven’t thought about it.”\\n\\n“Were you not going to attend? You were a hit at the last one.”\\n\\n“Yes. With my psychohistory. Some hit.”\\n\\n“You attracted the attention of the Emperor. No other mathematician did.”\\n\\n“It was you who were initially attracted, not the Emperor. Then I had to flee and stay out \\nof the Imperial notice until such time as I could assure you that I had made a start on my \\npsychohistorical research, after which you allowed me to remain in safe obscurity.”\\n\\n“Being the head of a prestigious Mathematics Department is scarcely obscurity.”\\n\\n“Yes, it is, since it hides my psychohistory.”\\n\\n“Ah, the food is arriving. For a while, let’s talk about other things as befits friends. How \\nis Dors?”\\n\\n“Wonderful. A true wife. Hounds me to death with her worries over my safety.”\\n\\n“That is her job.”\\n\\n“So she reminds me--frequently. Seriously, Daneel, I can never be sufficiently grateful to \\nyou for bringing us together.”\\n\\n“Thank you, Hari, but, to be truthful, I did not foresee married happiness for either of \\nyou, especially not Dors--”\\n\\n“Thank you for the gift just the same, however short of the actual consequences your \\nexpectations were.”\\n\\n',\n",
              " '“I’m delighted, but it is a gift, you will find, that may be of dubious further \\nconsequence--as is my friendship.”\\n\\nTo this, Seldon could make no reply and so, at a gesture from Demerzel, he turned to his \\nmeal.\\n\\nAfter a while, he nodded at the morsel of fish on his fork and said, “I don’t actually \\nrecognize the organism, but this is Mycogenian cooking.”\\n\\n“Yes, it is. I know you are fond of it.”\\n\\n“It’s the Mycogenians’ excuse for existence. Their only excuse. But they have special \\nmeaning to you. I mustn’t forget that.”\\n\\n“The special meaning has come to an end. Their ancestors, long, long ago, inhabited the \\nplanet of Aurora. They lived three hundred years and more and were the lords of the \\nFifty Worlds of the Galaxy. It was an Auroran who first designed and produced me. I \\ndon’t forget that; I remember it far more accurately--and with less distortion--than their \\nMycogenian descendants do. But then, long, long ago, I left them. I made my choice as \\nto what the good of humanity must be and I have followed it, as best I could, all this \\ntime.”\\n\\nSeldon said with sudden alarm, “Can we be overheard?”\\n\\nDemerzel seemed amused. “If you have only thought of that now, it is far too late. But \\nfear not, I have taken the necessary precautions. Nor have you been seen by too many \\neyes when you came. Nor will you be seen by too many when you leave. And those who \\ndo see you will not be surprised. I am well known to be an amateur mathematician of \\ngreat pretensions but of little ability. That is a source of amusement to those at the court \\nwho are not entirely my friends and it would not surprise anyone here that I should be \\nconcerned about laying the groundwork for the forthcoming Decennial Convention. It is \\nabout the convention that I wish to consult you.”\\n\\n“I don’t know that I can help. There is only one thing I could possibly talk about at the \\nconvention--and Ican’t talk about it. If I attend at all, it will only be as part of the \\naudience. I do not intend to present any papers.”\\n\\n“I understand. Still, if you would like to hear something curious, His Imperial Majesty \\nremembers you.”\\n\\n“Because you have kept me in his mind, I suppose.”\\n\\n',\n",
              " '“No. I have not labored to do so. However, His Imperial Majesty occasionally surprises \\nme. He is aware of the forthcoming convention and he apparently remembers your talk \\nat the earlier one. He remains interested in the matter of psychohistory and more may \\ncome of it, I must warn you. It is not beyond the bounds of possibility that he may ask to \\nsee you. The court will surely consider it a great honor--to receive the Imperial call \\ntwice in a single lifetime.”\\n\\n“You’re joking. What could be served by my seeing him?”\\n\\n“In any case, if you are called to an audience, you can scarcely refuse. --How are your \\nyoung protégés, Yugo and Raych?”\\n\\n“Surely you know. I imagine you keep a close eye on me.”\\n\\n“Yes, I do. On your safety but not on every aspect of your life. I am afraid my duties fill \\nmuch of my time and I am not all-seeing.”\\n\\n“Doesn’t Dors report?”\\n\\n“She would in a crisis. Not otherwise. She is reluctant to play the role of spy in \\nnonessentials.” Again the small smile.\\n\\nSeldon grunted. “My boys are doing well. Yugo is increasingly difficult to handle. He’s \\nmore of a psychohistorian than I am and I think he feels I hold him back. As for Raych, \\nhe’s a lovable rascal--always was. He won me over when he was a dreadful street urchin \\nand what’s more surprising is that he won over Dors. I honestly believe, Daneel, that if \\nDors grew sick of me and wanted to leave me, she would stay on anyway for her love of \\nRaych.”\\n\\nDemerzel nodded and Seldon continued somberly. “If Rashelle of Wye hadn’t found him \\nlovable, I would not be here today. I would have been shot down--” He stirred uneasily. \\n“I hate to think of that, Daneel. It was such an entirely accidental and unpredictable \\nevent. How could psychohistory have helped in any way?”\\n\\n“Have you not told me that, at best, psychohistory can deal only in probabilities and \\nwith vast numbers, not with individuals?”\\n\\n“But if the individual happens to be crucial--”\\n\\n“I suspect you will find that no individual is ever truly crucial. Not even I--or you.”\\n\\n',\n",
              " '“Perhaps you’re right. I find that, no matter how I work away under these assumptions, I \\nnevertheless think of myself as crucial, in a kind of supernormal egotism that transcends \\nall sense. --and you are crucial, too, which is something I have come here to discuss with \\nyou--as frankly as possible. I must know.”\\n\\n“Know what?” The remains of the meal had been cleared away by a porter and the \\nroom’s lighting dimmed somewhat so that the walls seemed to close in and give a \\nfeeling of great privacy.\\n\\nSeldon said, “Joranum.” He bit off the word, as though feeling the mention of the name \\nalone should be sufficient.\\n\\n“Ah Yes.”\\n\\n“You know about him?”\\n\\n“Of course. How could Inot know?”\\n\\n“Well, I want to know about him, too.”\\n\\n“What do you want to know?”\\n\\n“Come, Daneel, don’t play with me. Is he dangerous?”\\n\\n“Of course he is dangerous. Do you have any doubt of that?”\\n\\n“I mean, to you? To your position as First Minister?”\\n\\n“That is exactly what I mean. That is how he is dangerous.”\\n\\n“And you allow it?”\\n\\nDemerzel leaned forward, placing his left elbow on the table between them. “There are \\nthings that don’t wait for my permission, Hari. Let us be philosophical about it. His \\nImperial Majesty, Cleon, First of that Name, has now been on the throne for eighteen \\nyears and for all that time I have been his Chief of Staff and then his First Minister, \\nhaving served in scarcely lesser capacities during the last years of the reign of his father. \\nIt is a long time and First Ministers rarely remain that long in power.”\\n\\n“You are not the ordinary First Minister, Daneel, and you know it. Youmust remain in \\npower while psychohistory is being developed. Don’t smile at me. It’s true. When we \\nfirst met, eight years ago, you told me the Empire was in a state of decay and decline. \\n\\n',\n",
              " 'Have you changed your mind about that?”\\n\\n“No, of course not.”\\n\\n“In fact, the decline is more marked now, isn’t it?”\\n\\n“Yes, it is, though I labor to prevent that.”\\n\\n“And without you, what would happen? Joranum is raising the Empire against you.”\\n\\n“Trantor, Hari. Trantor. The Outer Worlds are solid and reasonably contented with my \\ndeeds so far, even in the midst of a declining economy and lessening trade.”\\n\\n“But Trantor is where it counts. Trantor--the Imperial world we’re living on, the capital \\nof the Empire, the core, the administrative center-- is what can overthrow you. You \\ncannot keep your post if Trantor says no.\\n\\n“I agree.”\\n\\n“And if you go, who will then take care of the Outer Worlds and what will keep the \\ndecline from being precipitate and the Empire from degenerating rapidly into anarchy?”\\n\\n“That is a possibility, certainly.”\\n\\n“So you must be doing something about it. Yugo is convinced that you are in deadly \\ndanger and can’t maintain your position. His intuition tells him so. Dors says the same \\nthing and explains it in terms of the Three Laws or Four of--of--”\\n\\n“Robotics,” put in Demerzel.\\n\\n“Young Raych seems attracted to Joranum’s doctrines--being of Dahlite origin, you see. \\nAnd I--I am uncertain, so I come to you for comfort, I suppose. Tell me that you have \\nthe situation well in hand.”\\n\\n“I would do so if I could. However, I have no comfort to offer. Iam in danger.”\\n\\n“Are you doing nothing?”\\n\\n“No. I’m doing a great deal to contain discontent and blunt Joranum’s message. If I had \\nnot done so, then perhaps I would be out of office already. But what I’m doing is not \\nenough.”\\n\\n',\n",
              " 'Seldon hesitated. Finally he said, “I believe that Joranum is actually a Mycogenian.”\\n\\n“Is that so?”\\n\\n“It is myopinion . I had thought we might use that against him, but I hesitate to unleash \\nthe forces of bigotry.”\\n\\n“You are wise to hesitate. There are many things that might be done that have side \\neffects we do not want. You see, Hari, I don’t fear leaving my post--if some successor \\ncould be found who would continue those principles that I have been using to keep the \\ndecline as slow as possible. On the other hand, if Joranum himself were to succeed me, \\nthen that, in my opinion, would be fatal.”\\n\\n“Then anything we can do to stop him would be suitable.”\\n\\n“Not entirely. The Empire can grow anarchic, even if Joranum is destroyed and I stay. I \\nmust not, then, do something that will destroy Joranum and allow me to stay--if that \\nvery deed promotes the Fall of the Empire. I have not yet been able to think of anything \\nI might do that would surely destroy Joranum and just as surely avoid anarchy.”\\n\\n“Minimalism,” whispered Seldon.\\n\\n“Dors explained that you would be bound by minimalism.”\\n\\n“Then my visit with you is a failure, Daneel.”\\n\\n“You mean that you came for comfort and didn’t get it.”\\n\\n“But I saw you because I sought comfort as well.”\\n\\n“Pardon me?”\\n\\n“And so I am.”\\n\\n“I’m afraid so.”\\n\\n“From me?”\\n\\n“From psychohistory, which should envision the route to safety that I cannot.”\\n\\nSeldon sighed heavily. “Daneel, psychohistory has not yet been developed to that point.”\\n\\n',\n",
              " 'The First Minister looked at him gravely. “You’ve had eight years, Hari.”\\n\\n“It might be eight or eight hundred and it might not be developed to that point. It is an \\nintractable problem.”\\n\\nDemerzel said, “I do not expect the technique to have been perfected, but you may have \\nsome sketch, some skeleton, some principle that you can use as guidance. Imperfectly, \\nperhaps, but better than mere guesswork.”\\n\\n“No more than I had eight years ago,” said Seldon mournfully. “Here’s what it amounts \\nto, then. You must remain in power and Joranum must be destroyed in such a way that \\nImperial stability is maintained as long as possible so that I may have a reasonable \\nchance to work out psychohistory. This cannot be done, however, unless I work out \\npsychohistory first. Is that it?”\\n\\n“It would seem so, Hari.”\\n\\n“Then we argue in a useless circle and the Empire is destroyed.”\\n\\n“Unless something unforeseen happens. Unless you make something unforeseen \\nhappen.”\\n\\n“I? Daneel, how can I do it without psychohistory?”\\n\\n“I don’t know, Hari.”\\n\\nAnd Seldon rose to go--in despair.\\n\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\n 12\\n\\n      For days thereafter Hari Seldon neglected his departmental duties to use his \\ncomputer in its news-gathering mode.\\n\\nThere were not many computers capable of handling the daily news from twenty-five \\nmillion worlds. There were a number of them at Imperial headquarters, where they were \\nabsolutely necessary. Some of the larger Outer World capitals had them as well, though \\nmost were satisfied with hyperconnection to the Central Newspost on Trantor.\\n\\n',\n",
              " 'A computer at an important Mathematics Department could, if it were sufficiently \\nadvanced, be modified as an independent news source and Seldon had been careful to do \\nthat with his computer. It was, after all, necessary for his work on psychohistory, though \\nthe computer’s capabilities were carefully ascribed to other, exceedingly plausible \\nreasons.\\n\\nIdeally the computer would report anything that was out of the ordinary on any world of \\nthe Empire. A coded and unobtrusive warning light would make itself evident and \\nSeldon could track it down easily. Such a light rarely showed, for the definition of “out \\nof the ordinary” was tight and intense and dealt with large-scale and rare upheavals.\\n\\nWhat one did in its absence was to ring in various worlds at random --not all twenty-five \\nmillion, of course, but some dozens. It was a depressing and even debilitating task, for \\nthere were no worlds that didn’t have their daily relatively minor catastrophes. A \\nvolcanic eruption here, a flood there, an economic collapse of one sort or another \\nyonder, and, of course, riots. There had not been a day in the last thousand years that \\nthere had not been riots over something or other on each of a hundred or more different \\nworlds.\\n\\nNaturally such things had to be discounted. One could scarcely worry about riots any \\nmore than one could about volcanic eruptions when both were constants on inhabited \\nworlds. Rather, if a day should come in which not one riot was reported anywhere,that \\nmight be a sign of something so unusual as to warrant the gravest concern.\\n\\nConcern was what Seldon could not make himself feel. The Outer Worlds, with all their \\ndisorders and misfortunes, were like a great ocean on a peaceful day, with a gentle swell \\nand minor heavings--but no more. He found no evidence of any overall situation that \\nclearly showed a decline in the last eight years or even in the last eighty. Yet Demerzel \\n(in Demerzel’s absence, Seldon could no longer think of him as Daneel) said the decline \\nwas continuing and he had his finger on the Empire’s pulse from day to day in ways that \\nSeldon could not duplicate--until such time as he would have the guiding power of \\npsychohistory at his disposal.\\n\\nIt could be that the decline was so small that it was unnoticeable till some crucial point \\nwas reached--like a domicile that slowly wears out and deteriorates, showing no signs of \\nthat deterioration until one night when the roof collapses.\\n\\nWhen would the roof collapse? That was the problem and Seldon had no answer.\\n\\nAnd on occasion, Seldon would check on Trantor itself. There, the news was always \\nconsiderably more substantial. For one thing, Trantor was the most highly populated of \\nall the worlds, with its forty billion people. For another, its eight hundred sectors formed \\n\\n',\n",
              " 'a mini-Empire all its own. For a third, there were the tedious rounds of governmental \\nfunctions and the doings of the Imperial family to follow.\\n\\nWhat struck Seldon’s eyes, however, was in the Dahl Sector. The elections for the Dahl \\nSector Council had placed five Joranumites into office. This was the first time, \\naccording to the commentary, that Joranumites had achieved sector office.\\n\\nIt was not surprising. Dahl was a Joranumite stronghold if any sector was, but Seldon \\nfound it a disturbing indication of the progress being made by the demagogue. He \\nordered a microchip of the item and took it home with him that evening.\\n\\nRaych looked up from his computer as Seldon entered and apparently felt the need to \\nexplain himself. “I’m helping Mom on some reference material she needs,” he said.\\n\\n“What about your own work?”\\n\\n“Done, Dad. All done.”\\n\\n“Good. --Look at this.” He showed Raych the chip in his hand before slipping it into the \\nmicroprojector.\\n\\nRaych glanced at the news item hanging in the air before his eyes and said, “Yes, I \\nknow.”\\n\\n“You do?”\\n\\n“Sure. I usually keep track of Dahl. You know, home sector and all.”\\n\\n“And what do you think about it?”\\n\\n“I’m not surprised. Are you? The rest of Trantor treats Dahl like dirt. Why shouldn’t \\nthey go for Joranum’s views?”\\n\\n“Do you go for them also?”\\n\\n“Well--” Raych twisted his face thoughtfully. “I got to admit some things he says appeal \\nto me. He says he wants equality for all people. What’s wrong with that?”\\n\\n“Nothing at all--if he means it. If he’s sincere. If he isn’t just using it as a ploy to get \\nvotes.”\\n\\n“True enough, Dad, but most Dahlites probably figure: What’s there to lose? We don’t \\n\\n',\n",
              " 'have equality now, though the laws say we do.”\\n\\n“It’s a hard thing to legislate.”\\n\\n“That’s not something to cool you off when you’re sweating to death.”\\n\\nSeldon was thinking rapidly. He had been thinking since he had come across this item. \\nHe said, “Raych, you haven’t been in Dahl since your mother and I took you out of the \\nsector, have you?”\\n\\n“Sure I was, when I went with you to Dahl five years ago on your visit there.”\\n\\n“Yes yes”--Seldon waved a hand in dismissal--”but that doesn’t count. We stayed at an \\nintersector hotel, which was not Dahlite in the least, and, as I recall, Dors never once let \\nyou out on the streets alone. After all, you were only fifteen. How would you like to visit \\nDahl now, alone, in charge of yourself--now that you’re fully twenty?”\\n\\nRaych chuckled. “Mom would never allow that.”\\n\\n“I don’t say that I enjoy the prospect of facing her with it, but I don’t intend to ask her \\npermission. The question is: Would you be willing to do this for me?”\\n\\n“Out of curiosity? Sure. I’d like to see what’s happened to the old place.”\\n\\n“Can you spare the time from your studies?”\\n\\n“Sure. I’ll never miss a week or so. Besides, you can tape the lectures and I’ll catch up \\nwhen I get back. I can get permission. After all, my old man’s on the faculty--unless \\nyou’ve been fired, Dad.”\\n\\n“Not yet. But I’m not thinking of this as a fun vacation.”\\n\\n“I’d be surprised if you did. I don’t think you know what a fun vacation is, Dad. I’m \\nsurprised you know the phrase.”\\n\\n“Don’t be impertinent. When you go there, I want you to meet with Laskin Joranum.”\\n\\nRaych looked startled. “How do I do that? I don’t know where he’s gonna be.”\\n\\n“He’s going to be in Dahl. He’s been asked to speak to the Dahl Sector Council with its \\nnew Joranumite members. We’ll find out the exact day and you can go a few days \\nearlier.”\\n\\n',\n",
              " '“And how do I get to see him, Dad? I don’t figure he keeps open house.”\\n\\n“I don’t, either, but I’ll leave that up to you. You would have known how to do it when \\nyou were twelve. I hope your keen edge hasn’t blunted too badly in the intervening \\nyears.”\\n\\nRaych smiled. “I hope not. But suppose I do see him. What then?”\\n\\n“Well, find out what you can. What’s he’s really planning. What he’s really thinking.”\\n\\n“Do you really think he’s gonna tell me?”\\n\\n“I wouldn’t be surprised if he does. You have the trick of inspiring confidence, you \\nmiserable youngster. Let’s talk about it.”\\n\\nAnd so they did. Several times.\\n\\nSeldon’s thoughts were painful. He was not sure where all this was leading to, but he \\ndared not consult Yugo Amaryl or Demerzel or (most of all) Dors. They might stop him. \\nThey might prove to him that his idea was a poor one and he didn’t want that proof. \\nWhat he planned seemed the only gateway to salvation and he didn’t want it blocked.\\n\\nBut did the gateway exist at all? Raych was the only one, it seemed to Seldon, who \\ncould possibly manage to worm himself into Joranum’s confidence, but was Raych the \\nproper tool for the purpose? He was a Dahlite and sympathetic to Joranum. How far \\ncould Seldon trust him?\\n\\nHorrible? Raych was hisson --and Seldon had never had occasion to mistrust Raych \\nbefore.\\n\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\n 13\\n\\n      If Seldon doubted the efficacy of his notion, if he feared that it might explode \\nmatters prematurely or move them desperately in the wrong direction, if he was filled \\nwith an agonizing doubt as to whether Raych could be entirely trusted to fulfill his part \\nsuitably, he nevertheless had no doubt--no doubt whatever--as to what Dors’s reaction \\nwould be when presented with thefait accompli .\\n\\n',\n",
              " 'And he was not disappointed--if that was quite the word to express his emotion.\\n\\nYet, in a manner, hewas disappointed, for Dors did not raise her voice in horror as he \\nhad somehow thought she would, as he had prepared himself to withstand.\\n\\nBut how was he to know? She was not as other women were and he had never seen her \\ntruly angry. Perhaps it was not in her to be truly angry --or what he would consider to \\nbetruly angry.\\n\\nShe was merely cold-eyed and spoke with low-voiced bitter disapproval. “You sent him \\nto Dahl? Alone?” Very softly. Questioningly.\\n\\nFor a moment Seldon quailed at the quiet voice. Then he said firmly, “I had to. It was \\nnecessary.”\\n\\n“Let me understand. You sent him to that den of thieves, that haunt of assassins, that \\nconglomeration of all that is criminal?”\\n\\n“Dors! You anger me when you speak like that. I would expect only a bigot to use those \\nstereotypes.”\\n\\n“You deny that Dahl is as I have described?”\\n\\n“Of course. There are criminals and slums in Dahl. I know that very well. We both know \\nthat. But not all of Dahl is like that. And there are criminals and slums in every sector, \\neven in the Imperial Sector and in Streeling.”\\n\\n“There are degrees, are there not? One is not ten. If all the worlds are crime-ridden, if all \\nthe sectors are crime-ridden, Dahl is among the worst, is it not? You have the computer. \\nCheck the statistics.”\\n\\n“I don’t have to. Dahl is the poorest sector on Trantor and there is a positive correlation \\nbetween poverty, misery, and crime. I grant you that.”\\n\\n“Yougrant me that! And you sent him alone? You might have gone with him, or asked \\nme to go with him, or sent half a dozen of his schoolmates with him. They would have \\nwelcomed a respite from their work, I’m sure.”\\n\\n“What I need him for requires that he be alone.”\\n\\n“And what do you need him for?”\\n\\n',\n",
              " 'But Seldon was stubbornly silent about that.\\n\\nDors said, “Has it come to this? You don’t trust me?”\\n\\n“It’s a gamble. I alone dare take the risk. I can’t involve you or anyone else.”\\n\\n“But it’s not you taking the risk. It’s poor Raych.”\\n\\n“He’s not taking any risk,” said Seldon impatiently. “He’s twenty years old, young and \\nvigorous and as sturdy as a tree--and I don’t mean the saplings we have here under glass \\non Trantor. I’m talking about a good solid tree in the Heliconian forests. And he’s a \\ntwister, which the Dahlites aren’t.”\\n\\n“You and your twisting,” said Dors, her coldness not thawing one whit. “You think that’s \\nthe answer to everything. The Dahlites carry knives. Every one of them. Blasters, too, \\nI’m sure.”\\n\\n“I don’t know about blasters. The laws are pretty strict when it comes to blasters. As for \\nknives, I’m positive Raych carries one. He even carries a knife on campus here, where \\nit’s strictly against the law. Do you think he won’t have one in Dahl?”\\n\\nDors remained silent.\\n\\nSeldon was also silent for a few minutes, then decided it might be time to placate her. He \\nsaid, “Look, I’ll tell you this much. I’m hoping he’ll see Joranum, who will be visiting \\nDahl.”\\n\\n“Oh? And what do you expect Raych to do? Fill him with bitter regrets over his wicked \\npolitics and send him back to Mycogen?”\\n\\n“Come. Really. If you’re going to take this sardonic attitude, there’s no use discussing \\nit.” He looked away from her, out the window at the blue-gray sky under the dome. \\n“What I expect him to do”--and his voice faltered for a moment “is save the Empire.”\\n\\n“To be sure. That would be much easier.”\\n\\nSeldon’s voice firmed. “It’s what Iexpect . You have no solution. Demerzel himself has \\nno solution. He as much as said that the solution rests with me. That’s what I’m striving \\nfor and that’s what I need Raych for in Dahl. After all, you know that ability of his to \\ninspire affection. It worked with us and I’m convinced it will work with Joranum. If I \\nam right, all may be well.”\\n\\n',\n",
              " 'Dors’s eyes widened a trifle. “Are you now going to tell me that you are being guided by \\npsychohistory?”\\n\\n“No. I’m not going to lie to you. I have not reached the point where I can be guided in \\nany way by psychohistory, but Yugo is constantly talking about intuition--and I have \\nmine.”\\n\\n“Intuition! What’s that? Define it!”\\n\\n“Easily. Intuition is the art, peculiar to the human mind, of working out the correct \\nanswer from data that is, in itself, incomplete or even, perhaps, misleading.”\\n\\n“And you’ve done it.”\\n\\nAnd Seldon said with firm conviction, “Yes, I have.”\\n\\nBut to himself, he thought what he dared not share with Dors. What if Raych’s charm \\nwere gone? Or, worse, what if the consciousness of being a Dahlite became too strong \\nfor him?\\n\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\n 14\\n\\n      Billibotton was Billibotton--dirty, sprawling, dark, sinuous Billibotton--exuding \\ndecay and yet full of a vitality that Raych was convinced was to be found nowhere else \\non Trantor. Perhaps it was to be found nowhere else in the Empire, though Raych knew \\nnothing, firsthand, of any world but Trantor.\\n\\nHe had last seen Billibotton when he was not much more than twelve, but even the \\npeople seemed to be the same; still a mixture of the hangdog and the irreverent; filled \\nwith a synthetic pride and a grumbling resentment; the men marked by their dark rich \\nmustaches and the women by their sacklike dresses that now looked tremendously \\nslatternly to Raych’s older and more worldly wise eyes.\\n\\nHow could women with dresses like that attract men? --but it was a foolish question. \\nEven when he was twelve, he had had a pretty clear idea of how easily and quickly they \\ncould be removed.\\n\\n',\n",
              " 'So he stood there, lost in thought and memory, passing along a street of store windows \\nand trying to convince himself that he remembered this particular place or that and \\nwondering if, among them all, there were people he did remember who were now eight \\nyears older. Those, perhaps, who had been his boyhood friends--and he thought uneasily \\nof the fact that, while he remembered some of the nicknames they had pinned on each \\nother, he could not remember any real names.\\n\\nIn fact, the gaps in his memory were enormous. It was not that eight years was such a \\nlong time, but it was two fifths of the lifetime of a twenty-year-old and his life since \\nleaving Billibotton had been so different that all before it had faded like a misty dream.\\n\\nBut the smells were there. He stopped outside a bakery, low and dingy, and smelled the \\ncoconut icing that reeked through the air--that he had never quite smelled elsewhere. \\nEven when he had stopped to buy tarts with coconut icing, even when they were \\nadvertised as “Dahl-style,” they had been faint imitations--no more.\\n\\nHe felt strongly tempted. Well, why not? He had the credits and Dors was not there to \\nwrinkle her nose and wonder aloud how clean--or, more likely, not clean--the place \\nmight be. Who worried about clean in the old days?\\n\\nThe shop was dim and it took a while for Raych’s eyes to acclimate. There were a few \\nlow tables in the place, with a couple of rather insubstantial chairs at each, undoubtedly \\nwhere people might have a light repast, the equivalent of moka and tarts. A young man \\nsat at one of the tables, an empty cup before him, wearing a once-white T-shirt that \\nprobably would have looked even dirtier in a better light.\\n\\nThe baker or, in any case, a server stepped out from a room in the rear and said in a \\nrather surly fashion, “What’ll ya have?”\\n\\n“A coke-icer,” said Raych in just as surly a fashion (he would not be a Billibottoner if he \\ndisplayed courtesy), using the slang term he remembered well from the old days.\\n\\nThe term was still current, for the server handed him the correct item, using his bare \\nfingers. The boy, Raych, would have taken that for granted, but now the man, Raych, felt \\ntaken slightly aback.\\n\\n“You want a bag?”\\n\\n“No,” said Raych, “I’ll eat it here.” He paid the server and took the coke-icer from the \\nother’s hand and bit into its richness, his eyes half closing as he did so.

There were other parts of Dahl aside from Billibotton and some parts with \\nconsiderable aspirations to gentility.\\n\\nRaych said, “Are you security officers? I don’t seem to recall the uniform you’re--”\\n\\n“We’re not security officers. You won’t find security officers in Billibotton much. We’re \\nthe Joranum Guard and we keep the peace here.

If you’re not security \\nofficers--”\\n\\n“Listen,” said the corporal in a hard voice, “don’t you question rights. We’re all there is \\nin Billibotton and we have the right because we take the right. You say you beat up these \\nthree men and I believe you. But you won’t beat us up.

I may not be widely read--an Emperor doesn’t have the time to be widely \\nread--but I know my Imperial history, at any rate. There have been a number of cases of \\nthese populists, as they are called, that have seized power in the last couple of centuries. \\nIn every case, they reduced the reigning Emperor to a mere figurehead.

Would he have dared do this if \\nhe didn’t know in advance he would succeed? Isn’t that evidence that this--what?--\\npsychohistory is working?”\\n\\n“It is merely evidence that Hari Seldon is foolhardy, Sire.

Raging winds were replaced by zephyrs and there were no extremes of \\nheat and cold--merely little changes that made you unzip the front of your shirt once in a \\nwhile or throw on a light jacket. And he had heard complaints about even so mild a \\ndeviation.\\n\\nBut now Hari was seeing real rain coming down drearily from a cold sky--and he had \\nnot seen such a thing in years--and he loved it; that was the thing. It reminded him of \\nHelicon, of his youth, of relatively carefree days, and he wondered if he might persuade \\nthe driver to take the long way to the Palace.\\n\\nImpossible!

It was not always safe to be informal, merely because the \\nEmperor ordered you to be so in an effusive moment.\\n\\nCleon gestured imperceptibly and at once the room came alive with automation as the \\ntable set itself and dishes began to appear.

However, I do have a mind of my own and I recall that when you \\nfirst came to Trantor you had this psychohistory thing you were playing with.”\\n\\n“I’m sure you also remember, Sire,” said Seldon softly, “that I explained at the time it \\nwas a mathematical theory without practical application.”\\n\\n“So you said. Do you still say so?”\\n\\n“Yes, Sire.”\\n\\n“Have you been working on it since?”\\n\\n“On occasion I toy with it, but it comes to nothing. Chaos unfortunately interferes and \\npredictability is not--”\\n\\nThe Emperor interrupted. “There is a specific problem I wish you to tackle. --Do help \\nyourself to the dessert, Seldon.

From \\nwhat little I have heard of these fantasies, robots are made out of metal, aren’t they?”\\n\\n“That’s so,” said Raych earnestly. “But what I heard is that there were a few robots that \\nlook just like human beings and they live forever--”\\n\\n',\n",
              " 'Namarti shook his head violently. “Legends! Ridiculous legends! JoJo, why are we \\nlistening--”\\n\\nBut Joranum cut him off quickly. “No, G.D. I want to listen. I’ve heard these legends, \\ntoo.”\\n\\n“But it’s nonsense, Jo-Jo.”\\n\\n“Don’t be in such a rush to say ‘nonsense.’ And even if it were, people live and die by \\nnonsense. It’s not what is so much as what peoplethink is. --Tell me, young man, putting \\nlegends to one side, what makes you think Demerzel is a robot? Let’s suppose that \\nrobots exist. What is it, then, about Demerzel that makes you sayhe is a robot? Did he \\ntell you so?”\\n\\n“No, sir,” said Raych.\\n\\n“Did your father tell you so?” asked Joranum.\\n\\n“No, sir. It’s just my own idea, but I’m sure of it.”\\n\\n“Why? What makes you so sure?”\\n\\n“It’s just something about him. He doesn’t change. He doesn’t get older. He doesn’t \\nshow emotions. Something about himlooks like he’s made of metal.”\\n\\nJoranum sat back in his chair and looked at Raych for an extended time. It was almost \\npossible to hear his thoughts buzzing.\\n\\nFinally he said, “Suppose heis a robot, young man. Why should you care? Does it matter \\nto you?”\\n\\n“Of course it matters to me,” said Raych. “I’m a human being. I don’t want no robot in \\ncharge of running the Empire.”\\n\\nJoranum turned to Namarti with a gesture of eager approval. “Do you hear that, G.D.? \\n‘I’m a human being. I don’t want no robot in charge of running the Empire.’ Put him on \\nholovision and have him say it. Have him repeat it over and over till it’s drummed into \\nevery person on Trantor--”\\n\\n“Hey,” said Raych, finally catching his breath. “I can’t say that on holovision. I can’t let \\nmy father find out--”\\n\\n',\n",
              " '“No, of course not,” said Joranum quickly. “We couldn’t allow that. We’ll just use the \\nwords. We’ll find some other Dahlite. Someone from each of the sectors, each in his \\nown dialect, but always the same message: ‘I don’t want no robot in charge of running \\nthe Empire.’“\\n\\nNamarti said, “And what happens when Demerzel proves he’snot a robot?”\\n\\n“Really,” said Joranum. “How will he do that? It would be impossible for him to do so. \\nPsychologically impossible. What? The great Demerzel, the power behind the throne, \\nthe man who has twitched the strings attached to Cleon I all these years and those \\nattached to Cleon’s father before him? Will he climb down now and whine to the public \\nthat he is, too, a human being? That would be almost as destructive to him asbeing a \\nrobot. G.D., we have the villain in a no-win situation and we owe it all to this fine young \\nman here.”\\n\\nRaych flushed.\\n\\nJoranum said, “Raych is your name, isn’t it? Once our party is in a position to do so, we \\nwon’t forget. Dahl will be treated well and you will have a good position with us. You’re \\ngoing to be Dahl’s sector leader someday, Raych, and you’re not going to regret you’ve \\ndone this. Are you, now?”\\n\\n“Not on your life,” said Raych fervently.\\n\\n“In that case, we’ll see that you get back to your father. You let him know that we intend \\nhim no harm, that we value him greatly. You can tell him you found that out in any way \\nyou please. And if you find anything else you think we might be able to use--about \\npsychohistory, in particular, you let us know.”\\n\\n“You bet. But do you mean it when you say you’ll see to it that Dahl gets some breaks?”\\n\\n“Absolutely. Equality of sectors, my boy. Equality of worlds. We’ll have a new Empire \\nwith all the old villainies of privilege and inequality wiped out.”\\n\\nAnd Raych nodded his head vigorously. “That’s what I want.”\\n\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\n 19\\n\\n',\n",
              " '      Cleon, Emperor of the Galaxy, was walking hurriedly through the arcade that led \\nfrom his private quarters in the Small Palace to the offices of the rather tremendous staff \\nthat lived in the various annexes of the Imperial Palace, which served as the nerve center \\nof the Empire.\\n\\nSeveral of his personal attaches walked after him, with looks of the deepest concern on \\ntheir faces. The Emperor did not walk to others. He summoned them and they came to \\nhim. If he did walk, he never showed signs of haste or emotional trauma. How could he? \\nHe was the Emperor and, as such, far more a symbol of all the worlds than a human \\nbeing.\\n\\nYet now he seemed to be a human being. He motioned everyone aside with an impatient \\nwave of his right hand. In his left hand he held a gleaming hologram.\\n\\n“The First Minister,” he said in an almost strangled voice, not at all like the carefully \\ncultivated tones he had painstakingly assumed along with the throne. “Where is he?”\\n\\nAnd all the high functionaries who were in his way fumbled and gasped and found it \\nimpossible to manage coherence. He brushed past them angrily, making them all feel, \\nundoubtedly, as though they were living through a waking nightmare.\\n\\nFinally he burst into Demerzel’s private office, panting slightly, and shouted--literally \\nshouted-- “Demerzel!”\\n\\nDemerzel looked up with a trace of surprise and rose smoothly to his feet, for one did \\nnot sit in the presence of the Emperor unless specifically invited to. “Sire?” he said.\\n\\nAnd the Emperor slammed the hologram down on Demerzel’s desk and said, “What is \\nthis? Will you tell me that?”\\n\\nDemerzel looked at what the Emperor had given him. It was a beautiful hologram, sharp \\nand alive. One could almost hear the little boy--perhaps ten years old--speaking the \\nwords that were included in the caption: “I don’t want no robot in charge of running the \\nEmpire.”\\n\\nDemerzel said quietly, “Sire, I have received this, too.”\\n\\n“And who else has?”\\n\\n“I am under the impression, Sire, that it is a flier that is being widely spread over \\nTrantor.”\\n\\n',\n",
              " '“Yes, and do you see the person at whom that brat is looking?” He tapped his Imperial \\nforefinger at it. “Isn’t that you?”\\n\\n“The resemblance is striking, Sire.”\\n\\n“Am I wrong in supposing that the whole intent of thisflier , as you call it, is to accuse \\nyou of being a robot?”\\n\\n“That does seem to be its intention, Sire.”\\n\\n“And stop me if I’m wrong, but aren’t robots the legendary mechanical human beings \\none finds in--in thrillers and children’s stories?”\\n\\n“The Mycogenians have it as an article of faith, Sire, that robots--”\\n\\n“I’m not interested in the Mycogenians and their articles of faith. Why are they accusing \\nyou of being a robot?”\\n\\n“Merely a metaphorical point, I’m sure, Sire. They wish to portray me as a man of no \\nheart, whose views are the conscienceless calculations of a machine.”\\n\\n“That’s too subtle, Demerzel. I’m no fool.” He tapped the hologram again. “They’re \\ntrying to make people believe you are really a robot.”\\n\\n“We can scarcely prevent it, Sire, if people choose to believe that.”\\n\\n“We cannot afford it. It detracts from the dignity of your office. Worse than that, it \\ndetracts from the dignity of the Emperor, The implication is that I--Iwould choose as my \\nFirst Minister a mechanical man. That is impossible to endure. See here, Demerzel, \\naren’t therelaws that forbid the denigration of public officers of the Empire?”\\n\\n“Yes, there are--and quite severe ones, Sire, dating back to the great Law Codes of \\nAburamis.”\\n\\n“And to denigrate the Emperor himself is a capital offense, is it not?”\\n\\n“Death is the punishment, Sire. Yes.”\\n\\n“Well, this not only denigrates you, it denigrates me--and whoever did it should be \\nexecuted forthwith. It was this Joranum, of course, who is behind it.”\\n\\n“Undoubtedly. Sire, but proving it might be rather difficult.”\\n\\n',\n",
              " '“Nonsense! I have proof enough! I want an execution.”\\n\\n“The trouble is, Sire, that the laws of denigration are virtually never enforced. Not in this \\ncentury, certainly.”\\n\\n“And that is why society is becoming so unstable and the Empire is being shaken to its \\nroots. The laws are still in the books, so enforce them.”\\n\\nDemerzel said, “Consider, Sire, if that would be wise. It would make you appear to be a \\ntyrant and a despot. Your rule has been a most successful one through kindness and \\nmildness--”\\n\\n“Yes and see where that got me. Let’s have them fear me for a change, rather than love \\nme--in this fashion.”\\n\\n“I strongly recommend that you not do so, Sire. It may be the spark that will start a \\nrebellion.”\\n\\n“What would you do, then? Go before the people and say, ‘Look at me. I am no robot.”‘\\n\\n“No, Sire, for as you say that would destroy my dignity and, worse yet, yours.”\\n\\n“I am not certain, Sire. I have not yet thought it through.”\\n\\n“Not yet thought it through? --Get in touch with Seldon.”\\n\\n“Then?”\\n\\n“Sire?”\\n\\n“What is so difficult to understand about my order? Get in touch with Seldon!”\\n\\n“You wish me to summon him to the Palace, Sire?”\\n\\n“No, there’s no time for that.

He had spoken by \\nsealed lines before but never to the full extent of Imperial security.\\n\\nHe expected some government official to clear the way for Demerzel himself. \\nConsidering the slowly mounting tumult of the robot flier, he could expect nothing less.\\n\\nBut he did not expect anything more, either, and when the image of the Emperor \\nhimself, with the faint glitter of the scramble field outlining him, stepped into his office \\n(so to speak), Seldon fell back in his seat, mouth wide open, and could make only \\nineffectual attempts to rise.\\n\\nCleon motioned him impatiently to keep his seat. “You must know what’s going on, \\nSeldon.”\\n\\n“Do you mean about the robot flier, Sire?”\\n\\n“That’s exactly what I mean. What’s to be done?”\\n\\nSeldon, despite the permission to remain seated, finally rose. “There’s more, Sire. \\nJoranum is organizing rallies all over Trantor on the robot issue. At least, that’s what I \\nhear on the newscasts.”\\n\\n“It hasn’t reachedme yet. Of course not. Why should the Emperor know what is going \\non?”\\n\\n“It is not for the Emperor to be concerned, Sire. I’m sure that the First Minister--”\\n\\n“The First Minister will do nothing, not even keep me informed. I turn to you and your \\npsychohistory.Tell me what to do .”\\n\\n“Sire?”\\n\\n“I’m not going to play your game, Seldon. You’ve been working on psychohistory for \\neight years. The First Minister tells me I must not take legal action against Joranum. \\n\\n',\n",
              " 'What, then, do I do?”\\n\\nSeldon stuttered. “S-sire! Nothing!”\\n\\n“You have nothing to tell me?”\\n\\n“No, Sire. That is not what I mean. I mean you must do nothing.Nothing! The First \\nMinister is quite right if he tells you that you must not take legal action. It will make \\nthings worse.”\\n\\n“Very well. What will make things better?”\\n\\n“For you to do nothing. For the First Minister to do nothing. For the government to \\nallow Joranum to do just as he pleases.”\\n\\n“How will that help?”\\n\\nAnd Seldon said, trying to suppress the note of desperation in his voice, “That will soon \\nbe seen.”\\n\\nThe Emperor seemed to deflate suddenly, as though all the anger and indignation had \\nbeen drawn out of him. He said, “Ah! I understand! You have the situation well in \\nhand!”\\n\\n“Sire! I have not said that--”\\n\\n“You need not say. I have heard enough. You have the situation well in hand, but I want \\nresults. I still have the Imperial Guard and the armed forces. They will be loyal and, if it \\ncomes to actual disorders, I will not hesitate. But I will give you your chance first.”\\n\\nHis image flashed out and Seldon sat there, simply staring at the empty space where the \\nimage had been.\\n\\nEver since the first unhappy moment when he had mentioned psychohistory at the \\nDecennial Convention eight years before, he had had to face the fact that he didn’t have \\nwhat he had incautiously talked about.\\n\\nAll he had was the wild ghost of some thoughts--and what Yugo Amaryl called intuition.\\n\\n  \\n\\n 21\\n\\n',\n",
              " '  \\n\\n      In two days Joranum had swept Trantor, partly by himself, mostly through his \\nlieutenants. As Hari muttered to Dors, it was a campaign that had all the marks of \\nmilitary efficiency. “He was born to be a war admiral in the old days,” he said. “He’s \\nwasted on politics.”\\n\\nAnd Dors said, “Wasted? At this rate, he’s going to make himself First Minister in a \\nweek and, if he wishes, Emperor in two weeks. There are reports that some of the \\nmilitary garrisons are cheering him.”\\n\\nSeldon shook his head. “It will collapse, Dors.”\\n\\n“What? Joranum’s party or the Empire?”\\n\\n“Joranum’s party. The story of the robot has created an instant stir, especially with the \\neffective use of that flier, but a little thought, a little coolness, and the public will see it \\nfor the ridiculous accusation it is.”\\n\\n“But, Hari,” said Dors tightly, “you needn’t pretend withme . It isnot a ridiculous story. \\nHow could Joranum possibly have found out that Demerzel is a robot?”\\n\\n“Oh,that! Why, Raych told him so.”\\n\\n“Raych!”\\n\\n“That’s right. He did his job perfectly and got back safely with the promise of being \\nmade Dahl’s sector leader someday. Of course he was believed. I knew he would be.”\\n\\n“You mean you told Raych that Demerzel was a robot and had him pass on the news to \\nJoranum?” Dors looked utterly horrified.\\n\\n“No, I couldn’t do that. You know I couldn’t tell Raych--or anyone--that Demerzel was a \\nrobot. I told Raych as firmly as I could that Demerzel wasnot a robot--and even that \\nmuch was difficult. But I did ask him to tell Joranum that he was. He is under the firm \\nimpression that he lied to Joranum.”\\n\\n“But why, Hari? Why?”\\n\\n“It’s not psychohistory, I’ll tell you that. Don’t you join the Emperor in thinking I’m a \\nmagician. I just wanted Joranum to believe that Demerzel was a robot. He’s a \\n\\n',\n",
              " 'Mycogenian by birth, so he was filled from youth with his culture’s tales of robots. \\nTherefore, he was predisposed to believe and he was convinced that the public would \\nbelieve with him.”\\n\\n“Well, won’t they?”\\n\\n“Not really. After the initial shock is over, they will realize that it’s madcap fiction--or \\nthey will think so. I’ve persuaded Demerzel that he must give a talk on subetheric \\nholovision to be broadcast to key portions of the Empire and to every sector on Trantor. \\nHe is to talk about everything but the robot issue. There are enough crises, we all know, \\nto fill such a talk. People will listen and will hear nothing about robots. Then, at the end, \\nhe will be asked about the flier and he need not answer a word. He need only laugh.”\\n\\n“Laugh? I’ve never known Demerzel to laugh. He almost never smiles.”\\n\\n“This time, Dors, he’ll laugh. It is the one thing that no one ever visualizes a robot \\ndoing. You’ve seen robots in holographic fantasies, haven’t you? They’re always \\npictured as literal-minded, unemotional, inhuman-- That’s what people are sure to \\nexpect. So Demerzel need merely laugh. And on top of that-- Do you remember \\nSunmaster Fourteen, the religious leader of Mycogen?”\\n\\n“Of course I do. Literal-minded, unemotional, inhuman. He’s never laughed, either.”\\n\\n“And he won’t this time. I’ve done a lot of work on this Joranum matter since I had that \\nlittle set-to at the Field. I know Joranum’s real name. I know where he was born, who his \\nparents were, where he had his early training, and all of it, with documentary proof, has \\ngone to Sunmaster Fourteen. I don’t think Sunmaster likes Breakaways.”\\n\\n“But I thought you said you don’t wish to spark off bigotry.”\\n\\n“I don’t. If I had given the information to the holovision people, I would have, but I’ve \\ngiven it to Sunmaster, where, after all, it belongs.”\\n\\n“And he’ll start off the bigotry.”\\n\\n“Of course he won’t. No one on Trantor would pay any attention to Sunmaster--\\nwhatever he might say.”\\n\\n“Then what’s the point?”\\n\\n“Well, that’s what we’ll see, Dors. I don’t have a psychohistorical analysis of the \\nsituation. I don’t even know if one is possible. I just hope that my judgment is right.”\\n\\n',\n",
              " '  \\n\\n  \\n\\n 22\\n\\n      Eto Demerzel laughed.\\n\\nIt was not the first time. He sat there, with Hari Seldon and Dors Venabili in a tap-free \\nroom, and, every once in a while, at a signal from Hari, he would laugh. Sometimes he \\nleaned back and laughed uproariously, but Seldon shook his head. “That would never \\nsound convincing.”\\n\\nSo Demerzel smiled and then laughed with dignity and Seldon made a face. “I’m \\nstumped,” he said. “It’s no use trying to tell you funny stories. You get the point only \\nintellectually. You will simply have to memorize the sound.”\\n\\nDors said, “Use a holographic laughtrack.”\\n\\n“No!That would never be Demerzel. That’s a bunch of idiots being paid to yak. It’s not \\nwhat I want. Try again, Demerzel.”\\n\\nDemerzel tried again until Seldon said, “All right, then, memorize that sound and \\nreproduce it when you’re asked the question. You’ve got to look amused. You can’t \\nmake the sound of laughing, however proficient, with a grave face. Smile a little, just a \\nlittle. Pull back the corner of your mouth.” Slowly Demerzel’s mouth widened into a \\ngrin. “Not bad. Can you make your eyes twinkle?”\\n\\n“What do you mean, ‘twinkle,”‘ said Dors indignantly. “No one makes their eyes \\ntwinkle. That’s a metaphorical expression.”\\n\\n“No, it’s not,” said Seldon. “There’s the hint of tears in the eye-sadness, joy, surprise, \\nwhatever--and the reflection of light from that hint of fluid is what does it.”\\n\\n“Well, do you seriously expect Demerzel to produce tears?”\\n\\nAnd Demerzel said, matter-of-factly, “My eyes do produce tears for general cleansing--\\nnever in excess. Perhaps, though, if I imagine my eyes to be slightly irritated--”\\n\\n“Try it,” said Seldon. “It can’t hurt.”\\n\\n',\n",
              " 'And so it was that when the talk on subetheric holovision was over and the words were \\nstreaking out to millions of worlds at thousands of times the effective speed of light \\nwords that were grave, matter-of-fact, informative, and without rhetorical \\nembellishment--and that discussed everything but robots--Demerzel declared himself \\nready to answer questions.\\n\\nHe did not have to wait long. The very first question was: “Mr. First Minister, are you a \\nrobot?”\\n\\nDemerzel simply stared calmly and let the tension build. Then he smiled, his body shook \\nslightly, and he laughed. It was not a loud uproarious laugh, but it was a rich one, the \\nlaugh of someone enjoying a moment of fantasy. It was infectious. The audience tittered \\nand then laughed along with him.\\n\\nDemerzel waited for the laughter to die down and then, eyes twinkling, said, “Must I \\nreally answer that? Is it necessary to do so?” He was still smiling as the screen darkened.\\n\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\n 23\\n\\n      “I’m sure it worked,” said Seldon. “Naturally we won’t have a complete reversal \\ninstantly. It takes time. But things are moving in the right direction now. I noticed that \\nwhen I stopped Namarti’s talk at the University Field. The audience was with him until I \\nfaced him and showed spunk against odds. The audience began to change sides at once.”\\n\\n“Do you think this is an analogous situation?” asked Dors dubiously.\\n\\n“Of course. If I don’t have psychohistory, I can use analogy--and the brains I was born \\nwith, I suppose. There was the First Minister, beleaguered on all sides with the \\naccusation, and he faced it down with a smile and a laugh, the most nonrobot thing he \\ncould have done, so that in itself was an answer to the question. Of course sympathy \\nbegan to slide to his side. Nothing would stop that. But that’s only the beginning. We \\nhave to wait for Sunmaster Fourteen and hear what he has to say.”\\n\\n“Are you confident there, too?”\\n\\n“Absolutely.”\\n\\n  \\n\\n',\n",

He watched with impatience, therefore, as the Emperor Cleon, dressed in sports \\nfashion, loped across the court to return the ball. It was Imperial tennis, actually, so-\\ncalled because it was a favorite of Emperors, a version of the game in which a \\ncomputerized racket was used that could alter its angle slightly with appropriate \\npressures on the handle. Hari had tried to develop the technique on several occasions but \\nfound that mastering the computerized racket would take a great deal of practice--and \\nHari Seldon’s time was far too precious for what was clearly a trivial pursuit.\\n\\nCleon placed the ball in a nonreturnable position and won the game. He trotted off the \\ncourt to the careful applause of the functionaries who were watching and Seldon said to \\nhim, “Congratulations, Sire. You played a marvelous game.”\\n\\nCleon said indifferently, “Do you think so, Seldon? They’re all so careful to let me win. \\nI get no pleasure out of it.”\\n\\nSeldon said, “In that case, Sire, you might order your opponents to play harder.”\\n\\n“It wouldn’t help. They’d be careful to lose anyway. And if they did win, I would get \\neven less pleasure out of losing than out of winning meaninglessly. Being an Emperor \\nhas its woes, Seldon. Joranum would have found that out--if he had ever succeeded in \\nbecoming one.”\\n\\nHe disappeared into his private shower facility and emerged in due time, scrubbed and \\ndried and dressed rather more formally.\\n\\n“And now, Seldon” he said, waving all the others away, “the tennis court is as private a \\nplace as we can find and the weather is glorious, so let us not go indoors. I have read the \\nMycogenian message of this Sunmaster Fourteen. Will it do?”\\n\\n“Entirely, Sire. As you have read, Joranum was denounced as a Mycogenian Breakaway \\nand is accused of blasphemy in the strongest terms.”\\n\\n“And does that finish him?”\\n\\n“It diminishes his importance fatally, Sire. There are few who accept the mad story of \\nthe First Minister’s robothood now. Furthermore, Joranum is revealed as a liar and a \\n\\n',\n",
              " 'poseur and, worse, one who was caught at it.”\\n\\n“Caught at it, yes,” said Cleon thoughtfully. “You mean that merely to be underhanded is \\nto be sly and that may be admirable, while to be caught is to be stupid and that is never \\nadmirable.”\\n\\n“You put it succinctly, Sire.”\\n\\n“Then Joranum is no longer a danger.”\\n\\n“We can’t be certain of that, Sire. He may recover, even now. He still has an \\norganization and some of his followers will remain loyal. History yields examples of \\nmen and women who have come back after disasters as great as this one--or greater.”\\n\\n“In that case, let us execute him, Seldon.”\\n\\nSeldon shook his head. “That would be inadvisable, Sire. You would not want to create a \\nmartyr or to make yourself appear to be a despot.”\\n\\nCleon frowned. “Now you sound like Demerzel. Whenever I wish to take forceful \\naction, he mutters the word ‘despot.’ There have been Emperors before me who have \\ntaken forceful action and who have been admired as a result and have been considered \\nstrong and decisive.”\\n\\n“Undoubtedly, Sire, but we live in troubled times. Nor is execution necessary. You can \\naccomplish your purpose in a way that will make you seem enlightened and \\nbenevolent.”\\n\\n“Seemenlightened?”\\n\\n“Beenlightened, Sire. I misspoke. To execute Joranum would be to take revenge, which \\nmight be regarded as ignoble. As Emperor, however, you have a kindly--even paternal--\\nattitude toward the beliefs of all your people. You make no distinctions, for you are the \\nEmperor of all alike.”\\n\\n“What is it you’re saying?”\\n\\n“I mean, Sire, that Joranum has offended the sensibilities of the Mycogenians and you \\nare horrified at his sacrilege, he having been born one of them. What better can you do \\nbut hand Joranum over to the Mycogenians and allow them to take care of him? You will \\nbe applauded for your proper Imperial concern.”\\n\\n',\n",
              " '“And the Mycogenians will execute him, then?”\\n\\n“They may, Sire. Their laws against blasphemy are excessively severe. At best, they will \\nimprison him for life at hard labor.”\\n\\nCleon smiled. “Very good. I get the credit for humanity and tolerance and they do the \\ndirty work.”\\n\\n“They would, Sire, if you actually handed Joranum over to them. That would, however, \\nstill create a martyr.”\\n\\n“Now you confuse me. What would you have me do?”\\n\\n“Give Joranum the choice. Say that your regard for the welfare of all the people in your \\nEmpire urges you to hand him over to the Mycogenians for trial but that your humanity \\nfears the Mycogenians may be too severe. Therefore, as an alternative, he may choose to \\nbe banished to Nishaya, the small and secluded world from which heclaimed to have \\ncome, to live the rest of his life in obscurity and peace. You’ll see to it that he’s kept \\nunder guard, of course.”\\n\\n“And that will take care of things?”\\n\\n“Certainly. Joranum would be committing virtual suicide if he chose to be returned to \\nMycogen--and he doesn’t strike me as the suicidal type. He will certainly choose \\nNishaya, and though that is the sensible course of action, it is also an unheroic one. As a \\nrefugee in Nishaya, he can scarcely lead any movement designed to take over the \\nEmpire. His following is sure to disintegrate. They could follow a martyr with holy zeal, \\nbut it would be difficult, indeed, to follow a coward.”\\n\\n“Astonishing! How did you manage all this, Seldon?” There was a distinct note of \\nadmiration in Cleon’s voice.\\n\\nSeldon said, “Well, it seemed reasonable to suppose--”\\n\\n“Never mind,” said Cleon abruptly. “I don’t suppose you’ll tell me the truth or that I \\nwould understand you if you did, but I’ll tell you this much. Demerzel is leaving office. \\nThis last crisis has proved to be too much for him and I agree with him that it is time for \\nhim to retire.

I’ve been here too long \\nand the succession of crises has reached the point where the consideration of the Three \\nLaws paralyzes me. You are the logical successor.”\\n\\n“I amnot the logical successor,” said Seldon hotly. “What do I know about running an \\nEmpire? The Emperor is foolish enough to believe that I solved this crisis by \\npsychohistory. Of course I didn’t.”\\n\\n“That doesn’t matter, Hari. If hebelieves you have the psychohistorical answer, he will \\nfollow you eagerly and that will make you a Good First Minister.”\\n\\n“He may follow me straight into destruction.”\\n\\n“I feel that your good sense--orintuition --will keep you on target . . . with or without \\npsychohistory.”\\n\\n“But what will I do without you--Daneel?”\\n\\n“Thank you for calling me that. I am Demerzel no more, only Daneel. As to what you \\nwill do without me-- Suppose you try to put into practice some of Joranum’s ideas of \\nequality and social justice? He may not have meant them--he may have used them only \\nas ways of capturing allegiance--but they are not bad ideas in themselves. And find ways \\nof having Raych help you in that. He clung to you against his own attraction to \\nJoranum’s ideas and he must feel torn and half a traitor. Show him he isn’t. In addition, \\nyou can work all the harder on psychohistory, for the Emperor will be there with you, \\nheart and soul.”\\n\\n“But what willyou do, Daneel?”\\n\\n“I have other things in the Galaxy to which I must attend. There is still the Zeroth Law \\nand I must labor for the good of humanity, insofar as I can determine what that might be. \\nAnd, Hari--”\\n\\n“Yes, Daneel.”\\n\\n',\n",
              " '“You still, have Dors.”\\n\\nSeldon nodded. “Yes, I still have Dors.” He paused for a moment before grasping \\nDaneel’s firm hand with his own. “Good-bye, Daneel.”\\n\\n“Good-bye, Hari,” Daneel replied.\\n\\nAnd with that, the robot turned, his heavy First Minister’s robe rustling as he walked \\naway, head up, back ramrod straight, along the Palace hallway.\\n\\nSeldon stood there for a few minutes after Daneel had gone, lost in thought. Suddenly he \\nbegan moving in the direction of the First Minister’s apartment. Seldon had one more \\nthing to tell Daneel--the most important thing of all.\\n\\nSeldon hesitated in the softly lit hallway before entering. But the room was empty. The \\ndark robe was draped over a chair. The First Minister’s chambers echoed Hari’s last \\nwords to the robot: “Good-bye, my friend.” Eto Demerzel was gone; R.

Though often receiving panegyrics for being the last Emperor under \\nwhom the First Galactic Empire was reasonably united and reasonably prosperous, the \\nquarter-century reign of Cleon I was one of continuous decline. This cannot be viewed \\nas his direct responsibility, for the Decline of the Empire was based on political and \\neconomic factors too strong for anyone to deal with at the time. He was fortunate in his \\nselection of First Ministers-Eto Demerzel and then Hari Seldon, in whose development \\nof psychohistory the Emperor never lost faith.

              " '  \\n\\n 1\\n\\n  \\n\\n      Mandell Gruber was a happy man. He seemed so to Hari Seldon, certainly. Seldon \\nstopped his morning constitutional to watch him.\\n\\nGruber, perhaps in his late forties, a few years younger than Seldon, was a bit gnarled \\nfrom his continuing work in the Imperial Palace grounds, but he had a cheerful, \\nsmoothly shaven face, topped by a pink skull, not much of which was hidden by his thin \\nsandy hair. He whistled softly to himself as he inspected the leaves of the bushes for any \\nsigns of insect infestation.\\n\\nHe was not the Chief Gardener, of course. The Chief Gardener of the Imperial Palace \\ngrounds was a high functionary who had a palatial office in one of the buildings of the \\nenormous Imperial complex, with an army of men and women under him. The chances \\nare he did not inspect the Palace grounds more often than once or twice a year.\\n\\nGruber was but one of that army. His title, Seldon knew, was Gardener First-Class and it \\nhad been well earned, with thirty years of faithful service.\\n\\nSeldon called to him as he paused on the perfectly level crushed gravel walk, “Another \\nmarvelous day, Gruber.”\\n\\nGruber looked up and his eyes twinkled. “Yes, indeed, First Minister, and it’s sorry I am \\nfor those who be cooped up indoors.”\\n\\n“You mean as I am about to be.”\\n\\n“There’s not much about you, First Minister, for people to sorrow over, but if you’re \\ndisappearing into those buildings on a day like this, it’s a bit of sorrow that we fortunate \\nfew can feel for you.”\\n\\n“I thank you for your sympathy, Gruber, but you know we have forty billion Trantorians \\nunder the dome. Are you sorry for all of them?”\\n\\n“Indeed, I am. I am grateful I am not of Trantorian extraction myself so that I could \\nqualify as a gardener. There be few of us on this world that work in the open, but here I \\nbe, one of the fortunate few.”‘\\n\\n',\n",
              " '“The weather isn’t always this ideal.”\\n\\n“That is true. And I have been out here in the sluicing rains and the whistling winds. \\nStill, as long as you dress fittingly . . . . Look--” And Gruber spread his arms open, wide \\nas his smile, as if to embrace the vast expanse of the Palace grounds. “I have my \\nfriends--the trees and the lawns and all the animal life forms to keep me company--and \\ngrowth to encourage in geometric form, even in the winter. Have you ever seen the \\ngeometry of the grounds, First Minister?”\\n\\n“I am looking at it right now, am I not?”\\n\\n“I mean the plans spread out so you can really appreciate it all--and marvelous it is, too. \\nIt was planned by Tapper Savand, over a hundred years ago, and it has been little \\nchanged since. Tapper was a great horticulturist, the greatest--and he came from my \\nplanet.”\\n\\n“That was Anacreon, wasn’t it?”\\n\\n“Indeed. A far-off world near the edge of the Galaxy, where there is still wilderness and \\nlife can be sweet. I came here when I was still an earwet lad, when the present Chief \\nGardener took power under the old Emperor. Of course, now they’re talking of \\nredesigning the grounds.” Gruber sighed deeply and shook his head. “That would be a \\nmistake. They are just right as they are now properly proportioned, well balanced, \\npleasing to the eye and spirit. But it is true that in history, the grounds have occasionally \\nbeen redesigned. Emperors grow tired of the old and are always seeking the new, as if \\nnew is somehow always better. Our present Emperor, may he live long, has been \\nplanning the redesign with the Chief Gardener. At least, that is the word that runs from \\ngardener to gardener.” This last he added quickly, as if abashed at spreading Palace \\ngossip.\\n\\n“It might not happen soon.”\\n\\n“I hope not, First Minister. Please, if you have the chance to take some time from all the \\nheart-stopping work you must be after doing, study the design of the grounds. It is a rare \\nbeauty and, if I have my way, there should not be a leaf moved out of place, nor a \\nflower, nor a rabbit, anywhere in all these hundreds of square kilometers.”\\n\\nSeldon smiled. “You are a dedicated man, Gruber. I would not be surprised if someday \\nyou were Chief Gardener.”\\n\\n“May Fate protect me from that. The Chief Gardener breathes no fresh air, sees no \\n\\n',\n",
              " 'natural sights, and forgets all he has learned of nature. He lives there”--Gruber pointed \\nscornfully--”and I think he no longer knows a bush from a stream unless one of his \\nunderlings leads him out and places his hand on one or dips it into the other.”\\n\\nFor a moment it seemed as though Gruber would expectorate his scorn, but he could not \\nfind any place on which he could bear to spit.\\n\\nSeldon laughed quietly. “Gruber, it’s good to talk to you. When I am overcome with the \\nduties of the day, it is pleasant to take a few moments to listen to your philosophy of \\nlife.”\\n\\n“Ah, First Minister, it is no philosopher I am. My schooling was very sketchy.”\\n\\n“You don’t need schooling to be a philosopher. Just an active mind and experience with \\nlife. Take care, Gruber. I just might have you promoted.”\\n\\n“If you but leave me as I am, First Minister, you will have my total gratitude.”\\n\\nSeldon was smiling as he moved on, but the smile faded as his mind turned once more to \\nhis current problems. Ten years as First Minister--and if Gruber knew how heartily sick \\nSeldon was of his position, his sympathy would rise to enormous heights. Could Gruber \\ngrasp the fact that Seldon’s progress in the techniques of psychohistory showed the \\npromise of facing him with an unbearable dilemma?\\n\\n  \\n\\n 2\\n\\n  \\n\\n      Seldon’s thoughtful stroll across the grounds was the epitome of peace. It was hard \\nto believe here, in the midst of the Emperor’s immediate domain, that he was on a world \\nthat, except for this area, was totally enclosed by a dome. Here, in this spot, he might be \\non his home world of Helicon or on Gruber’s home world of Anacreon.\\n\\nOf course, the sense of peace was an illusion. The grounds were guarded--thick with \\nsecurity.\\n\\nOnce, a thousand years ago, the Imperial Palace grounds--much less palatial, much less \\ndifferentiated from a world only beginning to construct domes over individual regions--\\nhad been open to all citizens and the Emperor himself could walk along the paths, \\nunguarded, nodding his head in greeting to his subjects.\\n\\n',\n",
              " 'No more. Now security was in place and no one from Trantor itself could possibly \\ninvade the grounds. That did not remove the danger, however, for that, when it came, \\ncame from discontented Imperial functionaries and from corrupt and suborned soldiers. \\nIt waswithin the grounds that the Emperor and his staff were most in danger. What \\nwould have happened if, on that occasion, nearly ten years before, Seldon had not been \\naccompanied by Dors Venabili?\\n\\nIt had been in his first year as First Minister and it was only natural, he supposed (after \\nthe fact), that there would be jealous heart-burning over his unexpected choice for the \\npost. Many others, far better qualified in training--in years of service and, most of all, in \\ntheir own eyes--could view the appointment with anger. They did not know of \\npsychohistory or of the importance the Emperor attached to it and the easiest way to \\ncorrect the situation was to corrupt one of the sworn protectors of the First Minister.\\n\\nDors must have been more suspicious than Seldon himself was. Or else, with \\nDemerzel’s disappearance from the scene, her instructions to guard Seldon had been \\nstrengthened. The truth was that, for the first few years of his First Ministership, she was \\nat his side more often than not.\\n\\nAnd on the late afternoon of a warm sunny day, Dors noted the glint of the westering \\nsun--a sun never seen under Trantor’s dome--on the metal of a blaster.\\n\\n“Down, Hari!” she cried suddenly and her legs crushed the grass as she raced toward the \\nsergeant.\\n\\n“Give me that blaster, Sergeant,” she said tightly.\\n\\nThe would-be assassin, momentarily immobilized by the unexpected sight of a woman \\nrunning toward him, now reacted quickly, raising the drawn blaster.\\n\\nBut she was already at him, her hand enclosing his right wrist in a steely grip and lifting \\nhis arm high. “Drop it,” she said through clenched teeth.\\n\\nThe sergeant’s face twisted as he attempted to yank his arm loose.\\n\\n“Don’t try, Sergeant,” said Dors. “My knee is three inches from your groin and, if you so \\nmuch as blink, your genitals will be history. So just freeze. That’s right. Okay, now open \\nyour hand. If you don’t drop the blaster rightnow , I will shatter your arm.”\\n\\nA gardener came running up with a rake. Dors motioned him away. The sergeant \\ndropped the blaster to the ground.\\n\\n',\n",
              " 'Seldon had arrived. “I’ll take over, Dors.”\\n\\n“You willnot . Get in among those trees and take the blaster with you. Others may be \\ninvolved--and ready to act.”\\n\\nDors had not loosened her grip on the sergeant. She said, “Now, Sergeant, I want the \\nname of whoever it was who persuaded you to make an attempt on the First Minister’s \\nlife--and the name of everyone else ho is in this with you.”\\n\\nThe sergeant was silent.\\n\\nThe sergeant talked.\\n\\n“Don’t be foolish,” said Dors. “Speak!” She twisted his arm and he sank down to his \\nknees. She put her shoe on his neck. “If you think silence becomes you, I can crush your \\nlarynx and you will be silent forever. And even before that, I am going to damage \\nyoubadly --I won’t leave one bone unbroken. You had better talk.”\\n\\nLater Seldon had said to her, “How could you do that, Dors? I never believed you \\ncapable of such . . .violence .”\\n\\nDors said coolly, “I did not actually hurt him much, Hari. The threat was sufficient. In \\nany case, your safety was paramount.”\\n\\n“You should have let me take care of him.”\\n\\n“Why? To salvage your masculine pride? You wouldn’t have been fast enough, for one \\nthing. Secondly, no matter what you would have succeeded in doing, you are a man and \\nit would have been expected. I am a woman and women, in popular thought, are not \\nconsidered as ferocious its men and most, in general, do not have the strength to do what \\nI did. The story will improve in the telling and everyone will be terrified of me. No one \\nwill dare to try to harm you for fear of me.”\\n\\n“For fear of you and for fear of execution. The sergeant and his cohorts are to be killed, \\nyou know.”\\n\\nAt this, an anguished look clouded Dors’s usually composed visage, as if she could not \\nstand the thought of the traitorous sergeant being put to death, even though he would \\nhave cut down her beloved Hari without a second thought.\\n\\n“But,” she exclaimed, “there is no need to execute the conspirators. Exile will do the \\n\\n',\n",
              " 'job.”\\n\\n“No, it won’t,” said Seldon. “It’s too late. Cleon will hear of nothing but executions. I \\ncan quote him--if you wish.”\\n\\n“You mean he’s already made up his mind?”\\n\\n“At once. I told him that exile or imprisonment would be all that was necessary, but he \\nsaid no. He said, ‘Every time I try to solve a problem by direct and forceful action, first \\nDemerzel and then you talk of “despotism” and “tyranny.” But this ismy Palace. These \\nare my grounds. These aremy guardsmen. My safety depends on the security of this \\nplace and the loyalty of my people. Do you think that any deviation from absolute \\nloyalty can be met with anything but instant death? How else would you be safe? How \\nelse wouldI be safe?’\\n\\n“I said there would have to be a trial. ‘Of course,’ he said, ‘a short military trial and I \\ndon’t expect a single vote for anything but execution. I shall make that quite clear.’ “\\n\\nDors looked appalled. “You’re taking this very quietly. Do you agree with the \\nEmperor?”\\n\\nReluctantly Seldon nodded. “I do.”\\n\\n“Because there was an attempt onyour life. Have you abandoned your principles for \\nmere revenge?”\\n\\n“Now, Dors, I’m not a vengeful person. However, it was not myself alone at risk or even \\nthe Emperor. If there is anything that the recent history of the Empire shows us, it is that \\nEmperors come and go. It is psychohistory that must be protected. Undoubtedly, even if \\nsomething happens to me, psychohistory will someday be developed, but the Empire is \\nfalling fast and we cannot wait--and only I have advanced far enough to obtain the \\nnecessary techniques in time.”\\n\\n“Then you should teach what you know to others,” said Dors gravely.\\n\\n“I’m doing so. Yugo Amaryl is a reasonable successor and I have gathered a group of \\ntechnicians who will someday be useful, but they won’t be as--” He paused.\\n\\n“They won’t be as good as you--as wise, as capable? Really?”\\n\\n“I happen to think so,” said Seldon. “And I happen to be human. Psychohistory is mine \\nand, if I can possibly manage it, I want the credit.”\\n\\n',\n",
              " '“Human,” sighed Dors, shaking her head almost sadly.\\n\\nThe executions went through. No such purge had been seen in over a century. Two \\nMinisters, five officials of lower ranks, and four soldiers, including the hapless sergeant, \\nmet their deaths. Every guardsman who could not withstand the most rigorous \\ninvestigation was relieved of duty and exiled to the remote Outer Worlds.\\n\\nSince then, there had been no whisper of disloyalty and so notorious had become the \\ncare with which the First Minister was guarded, to say nothing of the terrifying woman--\\ncalled “The Tiger Woman” by many--who watched over him, that it was no longer \\nnecessary for Dors to accompany him everywhere. Her invisible presence was an \\nadequate shield and the Emperor Cleon enjoyed nearly ten years of quiet and absolute \\nsecurity.\\n\\nNow, however, psychohistory was finally reaching the point where predictions, of a sort, \\ncould be made and, as Seldon crossed the grounds in his passage from his office (First \\nMinister) to his laboratory (psychohistorian), he was uneasily aware of the likelihood \\nthat this era of peace might be coming to an end.\\n\\n  \\n\\n 3\\n\\n  \\n\\n      Yet, even so, Hari Seldon could not repress the surge of satisfaction that he felt as he \\nentered his laboratory.\\n\\nHow things had changed.\\n\\nIt had begun twenty years earlier with his own doodlings on his second-rate Heliconian \\ncomputer. It was then that the first hint of what was to become parachaotic math came to \\nhim in a cloudy fashion.\\n\\nThen there were the years at Streeling University, when he and Yugo Amaryl, working \\ntogether, attempted to renormalize the equations, get rid of the inconvenient infinities, \\nand find a way around the worst of the chaotic effects. They made very little progress, \\nindeed.\\n\\nBut now, after ten years as First Minister, he had a whole floor of the latest computers \\nand a whole staff of people working on a large variety of problems.\\n\\n',\n",
              " 'Of necessity, none of his staff--except for Yugo and himself, of course--could really \\nknow much more than the immediate problem they were dealing with. Each of them \\nworked with only a small ravine or outcropping on the gigantic mountain range of \\npsychohistory that only Seldon and Amaryl could see as a mountain range--and even \\nthey could see it only dimly, its peaks hidden in clouds, its slopes veiled by mist.\\n\\nDors Venabili was right, of course. He would have to begin initiating his people into the \\nentire mystery. The technique was getting well beyond what only two men could handle. \\nAnd Seldon was aging. Even if he could look forward to some additional decades, the \\nyears of his most fruitful breakthroughs were surely behind him.\\n\\nEven Amaryl would be thirty-nine within a month and, though that was still young, it \\nwas perhaps not overly young for a mathematician--and he had been working on the \\nproblem almost as long as Seldon himself. His capacity for new and tangential thinking \\nmight be dwindling, too.\\n\\nAmaryl had seen him enter and was now approaching. Seldon watched him fondly. \\nAmaryl was as much a Dahlite as Seldon’s foster son, Raych, was, and yet Amaryl, \\ndespite his muscular physique and short stature, did not seem Dahlite at all. He lacked \\nthe mustache, he lacked the accent, he lacked, it would seem, Dahlite consciousness of \\nany kind. He had even been impervious to the lure of Jo-Jo Joranum, who had appealed \\nso thoroughly to the people of Dahl.\\n\\nIt was as though Amaryl recognized no sectoral patriotism, no planetary patriotism, not \\neven Imperial patriotism. He belonged--completely and entirely--to psychohistory.\\n\\nSeldon felt a twinge of insufficiency. He himself remained conscious of his first two \\ndecades on Helicon and there was no way he could keep from thinking of himself as a \\nHeliconian. He wondered if that consciousness was not sure to betray him by causing \\nhim to skew his thinking about psychohistory. Ideally, to use psychohistory properly, one \\nshould be above worlds and sectors and deal only with humanity in the faceless \\nabstract--and this was what Amaryl did.\\n\\nAnd Seldon didn’t, he admitted to himself, sighing silently.\\n\\nAmaryl said, “Weare making progress, Hari, I suppose.”\\n\\n“You suppose, Yugo? Merely suppose?”\\n\\n“I don’t want to jump into outer space without a suit.” He said this quite seriously (he \\ndid not have much of a sense of humor, Seldon knew) and they moved into their private \\n\\n',\n",
              " 'office. It was small, but it was also well shielded.\\n\\nAmaryl sat down and crossed his legs. He said, “Your latest scheme for getting around \\nchaos may be working in part--at the cost of sharpness, of course.”\\n\\n“Of course. What we gain in the straightaway, we lose in the roundabouts. That’s the \\nway the Universe works. We’ve just got to fool it somehow.”\\n\\n“We’ve fooled it a little bit. It’s like looking through frosted glass.”\\n\\n“Better than the years we spent trying to look through lead.”\\n\\nAmaryl muttered something to himself, then said, “We can catch glimmers of light and \\ndark.”\\n\\n“Explain!”\\n\\n“I can’t, but I have the Prime Radiant, which I’ve been working on like a--a--”\\n\\n“Try lamec. That’s an animal--a beast of burden--we have on Helicon. It doesn’t exist on \\nTrantor.”\\n\\n“If the lamec works hard, then that is what my work on the Prime Radiant has been \\nlike.”\\n\\nHe pressed the security keypad on his desk and a drawer unsealed and slid open \\nnoiselessly. He took out a dark opaque cube that Seldon scrutinized with interest. Seldon \\nhimself had worked out the Prime Radiant’s circuitry, but Amaryl had put it together--a \\nclever man with his hands was Amaryl.\\n\\nThe room darkened and equations and relationships shimmered in the air. Numbers \\nspread out beneath them, hovering just above the desk surface, as if suspended by \\ninvisible marionette strings.\\n\\nSeldon said, “Wonderful. Someday, if we live long enough, we’ll have the Prime \\nRadiant produce a river of mathematical symbolism that will chart past and future \\nhistory. In it we can find currents and rivulets and work out ways of changing them in \\norder to make them follow other currents and rivulets that we would prefer.”\\n\\n“Yes,” said Amaryl dryly, “if we can manage to live with the knowledge that the actions \\nwe take, which we will mean for the best, may turn out to be for the worst.”\\n\\n',\n",
              " '“Believe me, Yugo, I never go to bed at night without that particular thought gnawing at \\nme. Still, we haven’t come to it yet. All we have is this --which, as you say, is no more \\nthan seeing light and dark fuzzily through frosted glass.”\\n\\n“True enough.”\\n\\n“And what is it you think you see, Yugo?” Seldon watched Amaryl closely, a little \\ngrimly. He was gaining weight, getting just a bit pudgy. He spent too much time bent \\nover the computers (and now over the Prime Radiant)--and not enough in physical \\nactivity. And, though he saw a woman now and then, Seldon knew, he had never \\nmarried. A mistake! Even a workaholic is forced to take time off to satisfy a mate, to \\ntake care of the needs of children.\\n\\nSeldon thought of his own still-trim figure and of the manner in which Dors strove to \\nmake him keep it that way.\\n\\nAmaryl said, “What do I see? The Empire is in trouble.”\\n\\n“The Empire is always in trouble.”\\n\\n“Yes, but it’s more specific. There’s a possibility that we may have trouble at the center.”\\n\\n“At Trantor?”\\n\\n“I presume. Or at the Periphery. Either there will be a bad situation here--perhaps civil \\nwar--or the outlying Outer Worlds will begin to break away.”\\n\\n“Surely it doesn’t take psychohistory to point out these possibilities.”\\n\\n“The interesting thing is that there seems a mutual exclusivity. One or the other. The \\nlikelihood of both together is very small. Here! Look! It’s your own mathematics. \\nObserve!”\\n\\nThey bent over the Prime Radiant display for a long time.\\n\\nSeldon said finally, “I fail to seewhy the two should be mutually exclusive.”\\n\\n“So do I, Hari, but where’s the value of psychohistory if it shows us only what we would \\nsee anyway? This is showing us something wewouldn’t see. What it doesn’t show us is, \\nfirst, which alternative is better, and second, what to do to make the better come to pass \\nand depress the possibility of the worse.”\\n\\n',\n",
              " 'Seldon pursed his lips, then said slowly, “I can tell you which alternative is preferable. \\nLet the Periphery go and keep Trantor.”\\n\\n“Really?”\\n\\n“No question. We must keep Trantor stable, if for no other reason than that we’re here.”\\n\\n“Surely our own comfort isn’t the decisive point.”\\n\\n“No, but psychohistory is. What good will it do us to keep the Periphery intact if \\nconditions on Trantor force us to stop work on psychohistory? I don’t say that we’ll be \\nkilled, but we may be unable to work. The development of psychohistory is on what our \\nfate will depend. As for the Empire, if the Periphery secedes it will only begin a \\ndisintegration that may take a long time to reach the core.”\\n\\n“Even if you’re right, Hari, what do we do to keep Trantor stable?”\\n\\n“To begin with, we have to think about it.”\\n\\nA silence fell between them and then Seldon said, “Thinking doesn’t make me happy. \\nWhat if the Empire is altogether on the wrong track and has been for all its history? I \\nthink of that every time I talk to Gruber.”\\n\\n“Who’s Gruber?”\\n\\n“Mandell Gruber. A gardener.”\\n\\n“Oh. The one who came running up with the rake to rescue you at the time of the \\nassassination attempt?”\\n\\n“Yes. I’ve always been grateful to him for that. He had only a rake against possibly other \\nconspirators with blasters. That’s loyalty. Anyhow, talking to him is like a breath of fresh \\nair. I can’t spend all my time talking to court officials and to psychohistorians.”\\n\\n“Thank you.”\\n\\n“Come! You know what I mean. Gruber likes the open. He wants the wind and the rain \\nand the biting cold and everything else that raw weather can bring to him. I miss it \\nmyself sometimes.”\\n\\n“I don’t. I wouldn’t care if I never go out there.”\\n\\n',\n",
              " '“You were brought up under the dome--but suppose the Empire consisted of simple \\nunindustrialized worlds, living by herding and farming, with thin populations and empty \\nspaces. Wouldn’t we all be better off?”\\n\\n“It sounds horrible to me.”\\n\\n“I found some spare time to check it as best I could. It seems to me it’s a case of \\nunstable equilibrium. A thinly populated world of the type I describe either grows \\nmoribund and impoverished, falling off into an uncultured near-animal level--or it \\nindustrializes. It is standing on a narrow point and topples over in either direction and, as \\nit just so happens, almost every world in the Galaxy has fallen over into \\nindustrialization.”\\n\\n“Because that’s better.”\\n\\n“Maybe. But it can’t continue forever. We’re watching the results of the overtoppling \\nnow. The Empire cannot exist for much longer because it has--it has overheated.

The best security was to go \\nunnoticed and, as long as the Spaceship-and-Sun, the symbol of the Empire, shone down \\nupon Seldon, all of the physical barriers in existence would be unsatisfactory.\\n\\nThe luxury in which they now lived--the careful shielding from spy beams, as well as \\nfrom physical interference; the advantages to her own historical research of being able to \\nmake use of nearly unlimited funds--did not satisfy her. She would gladly have \\nexchanged it all for their old quarters at Streeling University. Or, better yet, for a \\nnameless apartment in a nameless sector where no one knew them.\\n\\n“That’s all very well, Hari dear,” she said, “but it’s not enough.”\\n\\n“What’s not enough?”\\n\\n“The information you’re giving me. You say we might lose the Periphery. How? Why?”\\n\\nSeldon smiled briefly. “How nice it would be to know, Dors, but psychohistory is not yet \\nat the stage where it could tell us.”\\n\\n“In your opinion, then. Is it the ambition of local faraway governors to declare \\nthemselves independent?”\\n\\n“That’s a factor, certainly. It’s happened in past history--as you know far better than I--\\nbut never for long. Maybe this time it will be permanent.”\\n\\n“Because the Empire is weaker?”\\n\\n“Yes, because trade flows less freely than it once did, because communications are \\nstiffer than they once were, because the governors in the Periphery are, in actual fact, \\ncloser to independence than they have ever been. If one of them arises with particular \\nambitions--”\\n\\n“Can you tell which one it might be?”\\n\\n“Not in the least. All we can force out of psychohistory at this stage is the definite \\nknowledge thatif a governor of unusual ability and ambition arises, he would find \\nconditions more suitable for his purposes than he would have in the past. It could be \\nother things, too--some great natural disaster or some sudden civil war between two \\n\\n',\n",
              " 'distant Outer World coalitions. None of that can be precisely predicted as of now, but we \\ncan tell that anything of the sort that happens will have more serious consequences than \\nit would have had a century ago.”\\n\\n“But if you don’t know a little more precisely what will happen in the Periphery, how \\ncan you so guide actions as to make sure the Periphery goes, rather than Trantor?”\\n\\n“By keeping a close eye on both and trying to stabilize Trantor andnot trying to stabilize \\nthe Periphery. We can’t expect psychohistory to order events automatically without \\nmuch greater knowledge of its workings, so we have to make use of constant manual \\ncontrols, so to speak. In days to come, the technique will be refined and the need for \\nmanual control will decrease.”\\n\\n“But that,” said Dors, “is in days to come. Right?”\\n\\n“Right. And even that is only a hope.”\\n\\n“And just what kind of instabilities threaten Trantor--if we hang on to the Periphery?”\\n\\n“The same possibilities--economic and social factors, natural disasters, ambitious \\nrivalries among high officials. And something more. I have described the Empire to \\nYugo as being overheated--and Trantor is the most overheated portion of all. It seems to \\nbe breaking down. The infrastructure--water supply, heating, waste disposal, fuel lines, \\neverything--seems to be having unusual problems and that’s something I’ve been turning \\nmy attention to more and more lately.”\\n\\n“What about the death of the Emperor?”\\n\\nSeldon spread his hands. “That happens inevitably, but Cleon is in good health. He’s \\nonly my age, which I wish was younger, but he isn’t too old. His son is totally \\ninadequate for the succession, but there will be enough claimants. More than enough to \\ncause trouble and make his death distressing, but it might not prove a total catastrophe--\\nin the historic sense.”\\n\\n“Let’s say his assassination, then.”\\n\\nSeldon looked up nervously. “Don’t say that. Even if we’re shielded, don’t use the \\nword.”\\n\\n“Hari, don’t be foolish. It’s an eventuality that must be reckoned with. There was a time \\nwhen the Joranumites might have taken power and, if they had, the Emperor, one way or \\nanother--”\\n\\n',\n",

Did you ever come across the Globalist party on \\nmy native world of Helicon in your studies of the early history of the Kingdom of \\nTrantor and of the Galactic Empire?”\\n\\n“No, I haven’t. I don’t want to hurt your feelings, Hari, but I don’t recall coming across \\nany piece of history in which Helicon played a role.”\\n\\n“I’m not hurt, Dors. Happy the world without a history, I always say. --In any case, \\nabout twenty-four hundred years ago, there arose a group of people on Helicon who \\nwere quite convinced that Helicon was the only inhabited globe in the Universe. \\nHeliconwas the Universe and beyond it there was only a solid sphere of sky speckled \\nwith tiny stars.”\\n\\n“How could they believe that?” said Dors. “They were part of the Empire, I presume.”\\n\\n“Yes, but Globalists insisted that all evidence to the effect that the Empire existed was \\neither illusion or deliberate deceit, that Imperial emissaries and officials were \\nHeliconians playing a part for some reason. They were absolutely immune to reason.”\\n\\n“And what happened?”\\n\\n“I suppose it’s always pleasant to think that your particular world isthe world. At their \\npeak, the Globalists may have persuaded 10 percent of the population of the planet to be \\npart of the movement. Only 10 percent, but they were a vehement minority that drowned \\nout the indifferent majority and threatened to take over.”\\n\\n“But they didn’t, did they?”\\n\\n“No, they didn’t. What happened was that Globalism caused a diminishing of Imperial \\ntrade and the Heliconian economy slid into the doldrums. When the belief began to \\naffect the pocketbooks of the population, it lost popularity rapidly. The rise and fall \\npuzzled many at the time, but psychohistory, I’m sure, would have shown it to be \\ninevitable and would have made it unnecessary to give it any thought.”\\n\\n“I see. But, Hari, what is the point of this story? I presume there’s some connection with \\nwhat we were discussing.”\\n\\n',\n",

There may still be some remnants a thousand years from now.”\\n\\n“Isn’t it possible that a remnant may be dangerous?”\\n\\n“I doubt it. It was Jo-Jo’s charisma that made the movement dangerous--and he’s dead. \\nHe didn’t even die a heroic death or one that was in any way remarkable; he just \\nwithered away and died in exile, a broken man.”\\n\\nDors stood up and walked the length of the room quickly, swinging her arms at her sides \\nand clenching her fists.

He had a thin face, a sallow complexion, and a \\nwide mouth with lips so pale as to be nearly invisible. There was a touch of gray in his \\nhair, but his eyes burned with an inextinguishable anger.\\n\\nHe was staring at the man seated exactly opposite him--distinctly older and softer, his \\nhair almost white, his plump cheeks tending to quiver when he spoke.\\n\\nThe leader said sharply, “Well? It is quite apparent that you have done nothing. Explain \\nthat!”\\n\\nThe older man said, “I am an old Joranumite, Namarti.

I warned him against that accusation, but he wouldn’t listen--\\nand it destroyed him. Now let’s start fresh, shall we? Whatever use we make of \\nJoranum’s memory for outsiders, let us not ourselves be transfixed by it.”\\n\\nKaspalov sat silent. The other three transferred their gaze from Namarti to Kaspalov and \\nback, content to let Namarti carry the weight of the discussion.\\n\\n“With Joranum’s exile to Nishaya, the Joranumite movement fell apart and seemed to \\nvanish,” said Namarti harshly. “It would, indeed, have vanished--but for me. Bit by bit \\nand rubble by rubble, I rebuilt it into a network that extends over all of Trantor. You \\nknow this, I take it.”\\n\\n“I know it, Chief,” mumbled Kaspalov. The use of the title made it plain that Kaspalov \\nwas seeking reconciliation.\\n\\nNamarti smiled tightly. He did not insist on the title, but he always enjoyed hearing it \\nused. He said, “You’re part of this network and you have your duties.”\\n\\nKaspalov stirred. He was clearly debating with himself internally and finally he said \\nslowly, “You tell me, Chief, that you warned Joranum against accusing the old First \\nMinister of being a robot. You say he didn’t listen, but at least you had your say. May I \\nhave the same privilege of pointing out what I think is a mistake and have you listen to \\nme as Joranum listened to you, even if, like him, you don’t take the advice given you?”\\n\\n“Of course you can speak your piece, Kaspalov. You are here in order that you might do \\nso. What is your point?”\\n\\n“These new tactics of ours, Chief, are a mistake. They create disruption and do damage.”\\n\\n“Of course! They are designed to do that.” Namarti stirred in his seat, controlling his \\nanger with an effort. “Joranum tried persuasion. It didn’t work.

The Empire is decaying. Everyone knows that. Everyone capable of \\nintelligent thought knows that. The technology will fail here and there, even if we do \\nnothing. We’re just helping it along a little.”\\n\\n“It’s dangerous, Chief. Trantor’s infrastructure is incredibly complicated. A careless \\npush may bring it down in ruins. Pull the wrong string and Trantor may topple like a \\nhouse of cards.”\\n\\n“It hasn’t so far.”\\n\\n“It may in the future. And what if the people find out that we are behind it? They would \\ntear us apart. There would be no need to call in the security establishment or the armed \\nforces. Mobs would destroy us.”\\n\\n“How would they ever learn enough to blame us? The natural target for the people’s \\nresentment will be the government--the Emperor’s advisers. They will never look \\nbeyond that.”\\n\\n“And how do we live with ourselves, knowing what we have done?”\\n\\nThis last was asked in a whisper, the old man clearly moved by strong emotion. \\nKaspalov looked pleadingly across the table at his leader, the man to whom he had \\nsworn allegiance. He had done so in the belief that Namarti would truly continue to bear \\nthe standard of freedom passed on by Jo-Jo Joranum; now Kaspalov wondered if this is \\nhow Jo-Jo would have wanted his dream to come to pass.\\n\\nNamarti clucked his tongue, much as a reproving parent does when confronting an errant \\nchild.\\n\\n“Kaspalov, you can’t seriously be turning sentimental on us, are you? Once we are in \\npower, we will pick up the pieces and rebuild. We will gather in the people with all of \\nJoranum’s old talk of popular participation in government, with greater representation, \\nand when we are firmly in power we will establish a more efficient and forceful \\ngovernment. We will then have a better Trantor and a stronger Empire.

You just do your job. Do it in such a way that you hurt as few as possible--if your \\nconscience insists upon it--butdo it !”\\n\\nKaspalov said, “Look! I have one thing more to say, Chief.”\\n\\n“Then say it,” said Namarti wearily.\\n\\n“We can spend years poking at the infrastructure.

Namarti watched him go. He said to the man at his right, \\n“Kaspalov is not to be trusted. He has sold out and it’s only so that he can betray us that \\nhe wants to know my plans for the future.

And so, a tradition \\nwas born.”\\n\\nAnd as always, when hearing something like that, Seldon would think: And how would \\npsychohistory handle this? Would it predict that one area would remain undomed but be \\nabsolutely unable to say which area? Could it go even so far? Could it predict that \\nseveral areas would remain undomed or none--and be wrong?

He saw none, but he did notice a \\ngardener standing not far away, his body at attention (as it should be in the Imperial \\npresence) and his head respectfully bowed.\\n\\nCleon said, “Gardener!”\\n\\nThe gardener approached quickly. “Sire!”\\n\\n“Yes, Sire.”\\n\\nSeldon said, “I have a few, too, Gruber.”\\n\\n“Get rid of these for me,” he said, tapping the shells into the gardener’s hand.\\n\\n',\n",

Afterward--”\\n\\n“But you had me entrap him, despite my attraction to his views.”\\n\\nSeldon said, “it wasn’t easy for me to ask you to do that.”\\n\\n“And now you keep me working at the implementation of Joranum’s program, just to \\nshow me how hard the task is in reality.”\\n\\nSeldon said to Dors, “How do you like that, Dors? The boy attributes to me a kind of \\nsneaky underhandedness that simply isn’t part of my character.”\\n\\n“Surely,” said Dors with the ghost of a smile playing at her lips, “you are attributing no \\n\\n',\n",
              " 'such thing to your father.”\\n\\n“Not really. In the ordinary course of life, there’s no one straighter than you, Dad. But if \\nyou have to, you know you can stack the cards. Isn’t that what you hope to do with \\npsychohistory?”\\n\\nSeldon said sadly, “So far, I’ve done very little with psychohistory.”\\n\\n“Too bad. I keep thinking that there is some sort of psychohistorical solution to the \\nproblem of human bigotry.”\\n\\n“Maybe there is, but, if so, I haven’t found it.”\\n\\nWhen dinner was over, Seldon said, “You and I, Raych, are going to have a little talk \\nnow.”\\n\\n“Indeed?” said Dors. “I take it I’m not invited.”\\n\\n“Ministerial business, Dors.”\\n\\n“Ministerial nonsense, Hari. You’re going to ask the poor boy to do something I \\nwouldn’t want him to do.”\\n\\nSeldon said firmly, “I’m certainly not going to ask him to do anythinghe doesn’t want to \\ndo.”\\n\\nRaych said, “It’s all right, Mom. Let Dad and me have our talk. I promise I’ll tell you all \\nabout it afterward.”\\n\\nDors’s eyes rolled upward. “You two will plead ‘state secrets.’ I know\\n\\n“As a matter of fact,” said Seldon firmly, “that’s exactly what I must discuss. And of the \\nfirst magnitude. I’m serious, Dors.”\\n\\nDors rose, her lips tightening. She left the room with one final injunction. “Don’t throw \\nthe boy to the wolves, Hari.”\\n\\nAnd after she was gone, Seldon said quietly, “I’m afraid that throwing you to the wolves \\nis exactly what I’ll have to do, Raych.”\\n\\n  \\n\\n',\n",
              " ' 8\\n\\n  \\n\\n      They faced each other in Seldon’s private office, his “thinking place,” as he called it. \\nThere, he had spent uncounted hours trying to think his way past and through the \\ncomplexities of Imperial and Trantorian government.\\n\\nHe said, “Have you read much about the recent breakdowns we’ve been having in \\nplanetary services, Raych?”\\n\\n“Yes,” said Raych, “but you know, Dad, we’ve got an old planet here. What we gotta do \\nis get everyone off it, dig the whole thing up, replace everything, add the latest \\ncomputerizations, and then bring everyone back--or at least half of everyone. Trantor \\nwould be much better off with only twenty billion people.”\\n\\n“Which twenty billion?” asked Seldon smiling.\\n\\n“I wish I knew,” said Raych darkly. “The trouble is, we can’t redo the planet, so we just \\ngotta keep patching.”\\n\\n“I’m afraid so, Raych, but there are some peculiar things about it. Now I want you to \\ncheck me out. I have some thoughts about this.”\\n\\nHe brought a small sphere out of his pocket.\\n\\n“What’s that?” asked Raych.\\n\\n“It’s a map of Trantor, carefully programmed. Do me a favor, Raych, and clear off this \\ntabletop.”\\n\\nSeldon placed the sphere more or less in the middle of the table and placed his hand on a \\nkeypad in the arm of his desk chair. He used his thumb to close a contact and the light in \\nthe room went out while the tabletop glowed with a soft ivory light that seemed about a \\ncentimeter deep. The sphere had flattened and expanded to the edges of the table.\\n\\nThe light slowly darkened in spots and took on a pattern. After some thirty seconds, \\nRaych said in surprise, “Itis a map of Trantor.”\\n\\n“Of course. I told you it was. You can’t buy anything like this at a sector mall, though. \\nThis is one of those gadgets the armed forces play with. It could present Trantor as a \\nsphere, but a planar projection would more clearly show what I want to show.”\\n\\n',\n",
              " '“And what is it you want to show, Dad?”\\n\\n“Well, in the last year or two, there have been breakdowns. As you say, it’s an old planet \\nand we’ve got to expect breakdowns, but they’ve been coming more frequently and they \\nwould seem, almost uniformly, to be the result of human error.”\\n\\n“Isn’t that reasonable?”\\n\\n“Earthquakes? On Trantor?”\\n\\n“Yes, of course. Within limits. This is true, even where earthquakes are involved.”\\n\\n“I admit Trantor is a fairly nonseismic planet--and a good thing, too, because enclosing a \\nworld in a dome when the world is going to shake itself badly several times a year and \\nsmash a section of that dome would be highly impractical. Your mother says that one of \\nthe reasons Trantor, rather than some other world, became the Imperial capital is that it \\nwas geologically moribund--that’s her unflattering expression. Still, it might be \\nmoribund, but it’s not dead. There are occasional minor earthquakes --three of them in \\nthe last two years.”\\n\\n“I wasn’t aware of that, Dad.”\\n\\n“Hardly anyone is. The dome isn’t a single object. It exists in hundreds of sections, each \\none of which can be lifted and set ajar to relieve tensions and compressions in case of an \\nearthquake. Since an earthquake, when one does occur, lasts for only ten seconds to a \\nminute, the opening endures only briefly. It comes and goes so rapidly that the \\nTrantorians beneath are not even aware of it. They are much more aware of a mild \\ntremor and a faint rattling of crockery than of the opening and closing of the dome \\noverhead and the slight intrusion of the outside weather--whatever it is.”\\n\\n“That’s good, isn’t it?”\\n\\n“Still good.”\\n\\n“It should be. It’s computerized, of course. The onset of an earthquake anywhere sets off \\nthe key controls for the opening and closing of that section of the dome so that it opens \\njust before the vibration becomes strong enough to do damage.”\\n\\n“But in the case of the three minor earthquakes over the last two years, the dome \\ncontrols failed in each case. The dome never opened and, in each case, repairs were \\nrequired. It took some time, it took some money, and the weather controls were less than \\n\\n',\n",
              " 'optimum for a considerable period of time. Now, what, Raych, are the chances that the \\nequipment would have failed in all three cases?”\\n\\n“Not high?”\\n\\n“Not high at all. Less than one in a hundred. One can suppose that someone had \\ngimmicked the controls in advance of an earthquake. Now, about once a century, we \\nhave a magma leak, which is far more difficult to control--and I’d hate to think of the \\nresults if it went unnoticed until it was too late. Fortunately that hasn’t happened and \\nisn’t likely to, but consider-- Here on this map you will find the location of the \\nbreakdowns that have plagued us over the past two years and that seem to be attributable \\nto human error, though we haven’t once been able to tell towhom each might be \\nattributed.”\\n\\n“That’s because everyone is busy protecting his back.”\\n\\n“I’m afraid you’re right. That’s a characteristic of any bureaucracy and Trantor’s is the \\nlargest in history. --but what do you think of the locations?”\\n\\nThe map had lit up with bright little red markings that looked like small pustules \\ncovering the land surface of Trantor.\\n\\n“Well,” said Raych cautiously, “they seem to be evenly spread.”\\n\\n“Exactly-- andthat’s what’s interesting. One would expect that the older sections of \\nTrantor, the longest-domed sections, would have the most decayed infrastructure and \\nwould be more liable to events requiring quick human decision and laying the \\ngroundwork for possible human error. --I’ll superimpose the older sections of Trantor on \\nthe map in a bluish color and you’ll notice that the breakdowns don’t seem to be taking \\nplace any oftener on the blue areas.”\\n\\n“And?”\\n\\n“It don’t seem likely.”\\n\\n“And what I think it means, Raych, is that the breakdowns are not of natural origin but \\nare deliberately caused and spread out in this fashion to affect as many people as \\npossible, thus creating a dissatisfaction that is as widespread as possible.”\\n\\n“No? Then let’s look at the breakdowns as spread through time rather than through \\nspace.”\\n\\n',\n",
              " 'The blue areas and the red spots disappeared and, for a time, the map of Trantor was \\nblank--and then the markings began to appear and disappear one at a time, here and \\nthere.\\n\\n“Notice,” said Seldon, “that they don’t appear in clumps in time, either. One appears, \\nthen another, then another, and so on, almost like the steady ticking of a metronome.”\\n\\n“Do ya think that’s on purpose, too?”\\n\\n“It must be. Whoever is bringing this about wants to cause as much disruption with as \\nlittle effort as possible, so there’s no use doing two at once, where one will partially \\ncancel the other in the news and in the public consciousness. Each incident must stand \\nout in full irritation.”\\n\\nThe map went out and the lights went on. Seldon returned the sphere, shrunken back to \\nits original size, to his pocket.\\n\\nRaych said, “Who would be doing all this?”\\n\\nSeldon said thoughtfully, “A few days ago I received a report of a murder in Wye \\nSector.”\\n\\n“That’s not unusual,” said Raych. “Even though Wye isn’t one of your really lawless \\nsectors, there must be lots of murders there every day.”\\n\\n“Hundreds,” said Seldon, shaking his head. “We’ve had bad days when the number of \\ndeaths by violence on Trantor as a whole approaches the million-a-day mark. Generally \\nthere’s not much chance of finding every culprit, every murderer. The dead just enter the \\nbooks as statistics. This one, however, was unusual. The man had been knifed--but \\nunskillfully. He was still alive when found, just barely. He had time to gasp out one \\nword before he died and that word was ‘Chief.’\\n\\n“That roused a certain curiosity and he was actually identified. He works in Anemoria \\nand we don’t know what he was doing in Wye. But some worthy officer managed to dig \\nup the fact that he was an old Joranumite. His name was Kaspal Kaspalov and he is well \\nknown to have been one of the intimates of Laskin Joranum. And now he’s deadknifed.”\\n\\nRaych frowned. “Do you suspect another Joranumite Conspiracy, Dad? There aren’t any \\nJoranumites around anymore.”\\n\\n“It wasn’t long ago that your mother asked me if I thought that the Joranumites were still \\nactive and I told her that any odd belief always retained a certain cadre, sometimes for \\n\\n',\n",
              " 'centuries. They’re usually not very important, just splinter groups that simply don’t \\ncount. Still, what if the Joranumites have kept up an organization, what if they have \\nretained a certain strength, what if they are capable of killing someone they consider a \\ntraitor in their ranks, and what if they are producing these breakdowns as a preliminary \\nto seizing control?”\\n\\n“That’s an awful lot of ‘what if ‘s,’ Dad.”\\n\\n“I know that. And I might be totally wrong. The murder happened in Wye and, as it so \\nhappens, there have been no infrastructure breakdowns in Wye.”\\n\\n“What does that prove?”\\n\\n“It might prove that the center of the conspiracy is in Wye and that the conspirators \\ndon’t want to make themselves uncomfortable, only the rest of Trantor. It also might \\nmean that it’s not the Joranumites at all but members of the old Wyan family who still \\ndream of ruling the Empire once again.”\\n\\n“Oh boy, Dad. You’re building all this on very little.”\\n\\n“I know. Now suppose itis another Joranumite Conspiracy. Joranum had, as his right-\\nhand man, Gambol Deen Namarti. We have no record of Namarti’s death, no record of \\nhis having left Trantor, no record of his life over the last decade or so. That’s not terribly \\nsurprising. After all, it’s easy to lose one person among forty billion. There was a time in \\nmy life when I tried to do just that. Of course, Namarti may be dead. That would be the \\neasiest explanation, but he may not be.”\\n\\n“What do we do about it?”\\n\\nSeldon sighed. “The logical thing would be to turn to the security establishment, but I \\ncan’t. I don’t have Demerzel’s presence. He could cow people; I can’t. He had a \\npowerful personality; I’m just a--mathematician. I shouldn’t be First Minister at all; I’m \\nnot cut out for it. And I wouldn’t be--if the Emperor weren’t fixated on psychohistory to \\na far greater extent than it deserves.”\\n\\n“You’re kinda whipping yourself, ain’t you, Dad?”\\n\\n“Yes. I suppose I am, but I have a picture of myself going to the security establishment, \\nfor instance, with what I have just shown you on the map”--he pointed to the now-empty \\ntabletop--”and arguing that we were in great danger of some conspiracy of unknown \\nconsequence and nature. They would listen solemnly and, after I had left, they would \\nlaugh among themselves about ‘the crazy mathematician’--and then do nothing.’\\n\\n',\n",
              " '“Then what do we do about it?” said Raych, returning to the point.\\n\\n“It’s whatyou will do about it, Raych. I need more evidence and I want you to find it for \\nme. I would send your mother, but she won’t leave me under any circumstances. I \\nmyself can’t leave the Palace grounds at this time. Next to Dors and myself, I trust you. \\nMore than Dors and myself, in fact. You’re still quite young, you’re strong, you’re a \\nbetter Heliconian Twister than I ever was, and you’re smart.\\n\\n“Mind you, now, I don’t want you to risk your life. No heroism, no derring-do. I \\ncouldn’t face your mother if anything happened to you. Just find out what you can. \\nPerhaps you’ll find that Namarti is alive and operating--or dead. Perhaps you’ll find out \\nthat the Joranumites are an active group--or moribund. Perhaps you’ll find out that the \\nWyan ruling family is active--or not. Any of that would be interesting--but not vital. \\nWhat I want you to find out is whether the infrastructure breakdowns are of human \\nmanufacture, as I think they are, and, far more important still, if they are deliberately \\ncaused, what else the conspirators plan to do. It seems to me they must have plans for \\nsome major coup and, if so, I must know what that will be.”\\n\\nRaych said cautiously, “Do you have some kinda plan to get me started?”\\n\\n“Yes indeed, Raych. I want you to go down to the area of Wye where Kaspalov was \\nkilled. Find out if you can if he was an active Joranumite and see if you can’t join a \\nJoranumite cell yourself.”\\n\\n“Maybe that’s possible. I can always pretend to be an old Joranumite. It’s true that I was \\npretty young when Jo-Jo was sounding off, but I was very impressed by his ideas. It’s \\neven sorta true.”\\n\\n“Well yes, but there’s one important catch. You might be recognized. After all, you’re \\nthe son of the First Minister. You have appeared on holovision now and then and you \\nhave been interviewed concerning your views on sector equality.”\\n\\n“Sure, but--”\\n\\n“No buts, Raych. You’ll wear elevated shoes to add three centimeters to your height and \\nwe’ll have someone show you how to change the shape of your eyebrows and make \\nyour face fuller and change the timbre of your voice.”\\n\\nRaych shrugged. “A lotta trouble for nothing.”\\n\\n“And,” said Seldon with a distinct quaver, “you will shave off your mustache.”\\n\\n',\n",
              " 'Raych’s eyes widened and for a moment he sat there in appalled silence. Finally he said \\nin a hoarse whisper, “Shave my mustache?”\\n\\n“Clean as a whistle. No one would recognize you without it.”\\n\\n“But it can’t be done. Like cutting off your-- Like castration.”\\n\\nSeldon shook his head. “It’s just a cultural curiosity. Yugo Amaryl is as Dahlite as you \\nare and he wears no mustache.”\\n\\n“Yugo is anut . I don’t think he’s alive at all, except for his mathematics.”\\n\\n“He’s a great mathematician and the absence of a mustache does not alter that fact. \\nBesides, it’snot castration. Your mustache will grow back in two weeks.”\\n\\n“Two weeks! It’ll take twoyears to reach this--this--”\\n\\nHe put his hand up, as though to cover and protect it.\\n\\nSeldon said inexorably, “Raych, you have to do it. It’s a sacrifice you must make. If you \\nact as my spy with your mustache, you may--come to harm. I can’t take that chance.”\\n\\n“I’drather die,” said Raych violently.\\n\\n“Don’t be melodramatic,” said Seldon severely. “You wouldnot rather die and this is \\nsomething youmust do. However”--and here he hesitated--”don’t say anything about it \\nto your mother. I will take care of that.”\\n\\nRaych stared at his father in frustration and then said in a low and despairing tone, “All \\nright, Dad.”\\n\\nSeldon said, “I will get someone to supervise your disguise and then you will go to Wye \\nby air-jet. --Buck up, Raych, it’s not the end of the world.”\\n\\nRaych smiled wanly and Seldon watched him leave, a deeply troubled look on his face. \\nA mustache could easily be regrown, but a son could not.

              " '  \\n\\n      We all have our small illusions and Cleon--Emperor of the Galaxy, King of Trantor, \\nand a wide collection of other titles that on rare occasions could be called out in a long \\nsonorous roll--was convinced that he was a person of democratic spirit.\\n\\nIt always angered him when he was warned off a course of action by Demerzel (or, later, \\nby Seldon) on the grounds that such action would be looked on as “tyrannical” or \\n“despotic.”\\n\\nCleon was not a tyrant or despot by disposition, he was certain; he only wanted to take \\nfirm and decisive action.\\n\\nHe spoke many times with nostalgic approval of the days when Emperors could mingle \\nfreely with their subjects, but now, of course, when the history of coups and \\nassassinations--actual or attempted--had become a dreary fact of life, the Emperor had, \\nof necessity, been shut off from the world.\\n\\nIt is doubtful that Cleon, who had never in his life met with people except under the \\nmost constricted of conditions, would really have felt at home in offhand encounters \\nwith strangers, but he always imagined he would enjoy it. He was excited, therefore, for \\nthe rare chance of talking to one of the underlings on the grounds, to smile and to doff \\nthe trappings of Imperial rule for a few minutes. It made him feet democratic.\\n\\nThere was this gardener whom Seldon had spoken of, for instance. It would be fitting, \\neven a pleasure, to reward him belatedly for his loyalty and bravery--and to do so \\nhimself, rather than leaving it to some functionary.\\n\\nHe therefore arranged to meet the fellow in the spacious rose garden, which was in full \\nbloom. That would be appropriate, Cleon thought, but, of course, they would have to \\nbring the gardener there first. It was unthinkable for the Emperor to be made to wait. It \\nis one thing to be democratic, quite another to be inconvenienced.\\n\\nThe gardener was waiting for him among the roses, his eyes wide, his lips trembling. It \\noccurred to Cleon that it was possible that no one had told the man the exact reason for \\nthe meeting. Well, he would reassure him in kindly fashion--except that, now he came to \\nthink of it, he could not remember the fellow’s name.\\n\\nHe turned to one of the officials at his side and said, “What is the gardener’s name?”\\n\\n“Sire, it is Mandell Gruber. He has been a gardener here for thirty years.”\\n\\n',\n",
              " 'The Emperor nodded and said, “Ah, Gruber. How glad I am to meet a worthy and \\nhardworking gardener.”\\n\\n“Sire,” mumbled Gruber, his teeth chattering. “I am not a man of many talents, but it is \\nalways my best I try to do on behalf of your gracious self.”\\n\\n“Of course, of course,” said the Emperor, wondering if the gardener suspected him of \\nsarcasm. These men of the lower class lacked the finer feelings that came with \\nrefinement and manners, which always made any attempt at democratic display difficult.\\n\\nCleon said, “I have heard from my First Minister of the loyalty with which you once \\ncame to his aid and of your skill in taking care of the grounds. The First Minister tells \\nme that he and you are quite friendly.”\\n\\n“Sire, the First Minister is most gracious to me, but I know my place. I never speak to \\nhim unless he speaks first.”\\n\\n“Quite, Gruber. That shows good manners on your part, but the First Minister, like \\nmyself, is a man of democratic impulses and I trust his judgment of people.”\\n\\nGruber bowed low.\\n\\nThe Emperor said, “As you know, Gruber, Chief Gardener Malcomber is quite old and \\nlongs to retire. The responsibilities are becoming greater than even he can bear.”\\n\\n“Sire, the Chief Gardener is much respected by all the gardeners. May he be spared for \\nmany years so that we can all come to him for the benefit of his wisdom and judgment.”\\n\\n“Well said, Gruber,” said the Emperor carelessly, “but you very well know that that is \\njust mumbo-jumbo. He is not going to be spared, at least not with the strength and wit \\nnecessary for the position. He himself requests retirement within the year and I have \\ngranted him that. It remains to find a replacement.”\\n\\n“Oh, Sire, there are fifty men and women in this grand place who could be Chief \\nGardener.”\\n\\n“I dare say,” said the Emperor, “but my choice has fallen upon you.” The Emperor \\nsmiled graciously. This was the moment he had been waiting for. Gruber would now, he \\nexpected, fall to his knees in an ecstasy of gratitude.\\n\\nHe did not and the Emperor frowned.\\n\\n',\n",
              " 'Gruber said, “Sire, it is an honor that is too great for me--entirely.”\\n\\n“Nonsense,” said Cleon, offended that his judgment should be called into question. “It is \\nabout time that your virtues are recognized. You will no longer have to be exposed to \\nweather of all kinds at all times of the year. You will have the Chief Gardener’s office, a \\nfine place, which I will have redecorated for you, and where you can bring your family. \\n--You do have a family, don’t you, Gruber?”\\n\\n“Yes, Sire. A wife and two daughters. And a son-in-law.”\\n\\n“Very good. You will be very comfortable and you will enjoy your new life, Gruber. You \\nwill be indoors, Gruber, and out of the weather, like a true Trantorian.”\\n\\n“Sire, consider that I am an Anacreonian by upbringing--”\\n\\n“I have considered, Gruber. All worlds are alike to the Emperor. It is done. The new job \\nis what you deserved.”\\n\\nHe nodded his head and stalked off. Cleon was satisfied with this latest show of his \\nbenevolence. Of course, he could have used a little more gratitude from the fellow, a \\nlittle more appreciation, but at least the task was done.\\n\\nAnd it was much easier to havethis done than to settle the matter of the failing \\ninfrastructure.\\n\\nCleon had, in a moment of testiness, declared that whenever a breakdown could be \\nattributed to human error, the human being in question should forthwith be executed.\\n\\n“Just a few executions,” he said, “and it will be remarkable how careful everyone will \\nbecome.”\\n\\n“I’m afraid, Sire,” Seldon had said, “that this type of despotic behavior would not \\naccomplish what you wish. It would probably force the workers to go on strike--and if \\nyou try to force them back to work, there would then be an insurrection--and if you try \\nto replace them with soldiers, you will find they do not know how to control the \\nmachinery, so that breakdowns will begin to take place much more frequently.”\\n\\nIt was no wonder that Cleon turned to the matter of appointing a Chief Gardener with \\nrelief.\\n\\nAs for Gruber, he gazed after the departing Emperor with the chill of sheer horror.

Just that Kaspalov \\nhad been murdered and that the local security officers had come up with nothing of \\nimportance in connection with that murder. It seemed quite clear that the security \\nofficers attached little or no importance to it, anyway.\\n\\nThat was not surprising. In the last century, the crime rate had risen markedly in most \\nworlds,certainly in the grandly complex world of Trantor, and nowhere were the local \\nsecurity officers up to the job of doing anything useful about it. In fact, the security \\nestablishment had declined in numbers and efficiency everywhere and (while this was \\nhard to prove) had become more corrupt. It was inevitable this should be so, with pay \\nrefusing to keep pace with the cost of living. One mustpay civil officials to keep them \\nhonest. Failing that, they would surely make up for their inadequate salaries in other \\nways.\\n\\nSeldon had been preaching this doctrine for some years now, but it did no good. There \\nwas no way to increase wages without increasing taxes and the populace would not sit \\nstill for increased taxes.

Do you know of any?”\\n\\n“What kind of job?”\\n\\nRaych shrugged. “I don’t have any experience in anything fancy, but I ain’t proud.”\\n\\nManella looked at him thoughtfully. “I’ll tell you what, Mr. Nameless. Sometimes it \\ndoesn’t take any credits at all.”\\n\\nRaych froze at once. He had been successful enough with women, but with his \\nmustache--his mustache. What could she see in his baby face?\\n\\nHe said, “Tell you what. I had a friend living here a couple of weeks ago and I can’t find \\nhim. Since you know all the regulars, maybe you know him. His name is Kaspalov.” He \\nraised his voice slightly. “Kaspal Kaspalov.”\\n\\nManella stared at him blankly and shook her head. “I don’t know anybody by that \\nname.”\\n\\n“Too bad. He was a Joranumite and so am I” Again, a blank look. “Do you know what a \\nJoranumite is?”\\n\\nShe shook her head. “N-no. I’ve heard the word, but I don’t know what it means. Is it \\nsome kind of job?”\\n\\nRaych felt disappointed.\\n\\nHe said, “It would take too long to explain.”\\n\\nIt sounded like a dismissal and, after a moment of uncertainty, Manella rose and drifted \\naway. She did not smile and Raych was a little surprised that she had remained as long \\n\\n',\n",
              " 'as she did.\\n\\n(Well, Seldon had always insisted that Raych had the capacity to inspire affection--but \\nsurely not in a businesswoman of this sort. For them, payment was the thing.)\\n\\nHis eyes followed Manella automatically as she stopped at another table, where a man \\nwas seated by himself. He was of early middle age, with butter-yellow hair, slicked \\nback. He was very smooth-shaven, but it seemed to Raych that he could have used a \\nbeard, his chin being too prominent and a bit asymmetric.\\n\\nApparently Manella had no better luck with this beardless one. A few words were \\nexchanged and she moved on. Too bad, but surely it was impossible for her to fail often. \\nShe was unquestionably desirable.\\n\\nRaych found himself thinking, quite involuntarily, of what the upshot would be if he, \\nafter all, could-- And then Raych realized that he had been joined by someone else. It \\nwas a man this time. It was, in fact, the man to whom Manella had just spoken. He was \\nastonished that his own preoccupation had allowed him to be thus approached and, in \\neffect, caught by surprise. He couldn’t very well afford this sort of thing.\\n\\nThe man looked at him with a glint of curiosity in his eyes. “You were just talking to a \\nfriend of mine.”\\n\\nRaych could not help smiling broadly. “She’s a friendly person.”\\n\\n“Yes, she is. And agood friend of mine. I couldn’t help overhearing what you said to \\nher.”\\n\\n“Wasn’t nothing wrong, I think.”\\n\\n“Not at all, but you called yourself a Joranumite.”\\n\\nRaych’s heart jumped. His remark to Manella had hit dead-center after all. It had meant \\nnothing to her, but it seemed to mean something to her “friend.”\\n\\nDid that mean he was on the road now? Or merely in trouble?\\n\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\n 12\\n\\n',\n",
              " '      Raych did his best to size up his new companion, without allowing his own face to \\nlose its smooth naiveté. The man had sharp greenish eyes and his right hand clenched \\nalmost threateningly into a fist as it rested on the table.\\n\\nRaych looked owlishly at the other and waited.\\n\\nAgain, the man said, “I understand you call yourself a Joranumite.”\\n\\nRaych did his best to look uneasy. It was not difficult. He said, “Why do you ask, \\nmister?”\\n\\n“Because I don’t think you’re old enough.”\\n\\n“I’m old enough. I used to watch Jo-Jo Joranum’s speeches on holovision.”\\n\\n“Can you quote them?”\\n\\nRaych shrugged. “No, but I got the idea.”\\n\\n“You’re a brave young man to talk openly about being a Joranumite. Some people don’t \\nlike that.”\\n\\n“I’m told there are lots of Joranumites in Wye.”\\n\\n“That may be. Is that why you came here?”\\n\\n“I’m looking for a job. Maybe another Joranumite would help me.”\\n\\n“There are Joranumites in Dahl, too. Where are you from?”\\n\\nThere was no question that he recognized Raych’s accent. That could not be disguised.\\n\\nHe said, “I was born in Millimaru, but I lived mostly in Dahl when I was growing up.”\\n\\n“Doing what?”\\n\\n“Nothing much. Going to school some.”\\n\\n“And why are you a Joranumite?”\\n\\nRaych let himself heat up a bit. He couldn’t have lived in downtrodden, discriminated-\\n\\n',\n",
              " 'against Dahl without having obvious reasons for being a Joranumite. He said, “Because \\nI think there should be more representative government in the Empire, more \\nparticipation by the people, and more equality among the sectors and the worlds. \\nDoesn’t anyone with brains and a heart think that?”\\n\\n“And you want to see the Emperorship abolished?”\\n\\nRaych paused. One could get away with a great deal in the way of subversive \\nstatements, but anything overtly anti-Emperor was stepping outside the bounds. He said, \\n“I ain’t saying that. I believe in the Emperor, but ruling a whole Empire is too much for \\none man.”\\n\\n“It isn’t one man. There’s a whole Imperial bureaucracy. What do you think of Hari \\nSeldon, the First Minister?”\\n\\n“Don’t think nothing about him. Don’t know about him.”\\n\\n“All you know is that people should be more represented in the affairs of government. Is \\nthat right?”\\n\\nRaych allowed himself to look confused. “That’s what Jo-Jo Joranum used to say. I \\ndon’t know what you call it. I heard someone once call it ‘democracy,’ but I don’t know \\nwhat that means.”\\n\\n“Democracy is something that some worlds have tried. Some still do. I don’t know that \\nthose worlds are run better than other worlds. So you’re a democrat?”\\n\\n“Is that what you call it?” Raych let his head sink, as if in deep thought. “I feel more at \\nhome as a Joranumite.”\\n\\n“Of course, as a Dahlite--”\\n\\n“I just lived there awhile.”\\n\\n“--You’re all for people’s equalities and such things. The Dahlites, being an oppressed \\ngroup, would naturally think in that fashion.”\\n\\n“I hear that Wye is pretty strong in Joranumite thinking.They’re not oppressed.”\\n\\n“Different reason. The old Wye Mayors always wanted to be Emperors. Did you know \\nthat?”\\n\\n',\n",
              " 'Raych shook his head.\\n\\n“Eighteen years ago,” said the man, “Mayor Rashelle nearly carried through a coup in \\nthat direction. So the Wyans are rebels, not so much Joranumite as anti-Cleon.”\\n\\nRaych said, “I don’t know nothing about that. I ain’t against the Emperor.”\\n\\n“But you are for popular representation, aren’t you? Do you think that some sort of \\nelected assembly could run the Galactic Empire without bogging down in politics and \\npartisan bickering? Without paralysis?”\\n\\nRaych said, “Huh? I don’t understand.”\\n\\n“Do you think a great many people could come to some decision quickly in times of \\nemergency? Or would they just sit around and argue?”\\n\\n“I don’t know, but it doesn’t seem right that just a few people should have all the say \\nover all the worlds.”\\n\\n“Are you willing to fight for your beliefs? Or do you just like to talk about them?”\\n\\n“No one asked me to do any fighting,” said Raych.\\n\\n“Suppose someone did. How important do you think your beliefs about democracy--or \\nJoranumite philosophy--are?”\\n\\n“I’d fight for them--if I thought it would do any good.”\\n\\n“There’s a brave lad. So you came to Wye to fight for your beliefs.”\\n\\n“No,” said Raych uncomfortably, “I can’t say I did. I came to look for a job, sir. It ain’t \\neasy to find no jobs these days--and I ain’t got no credits. A guy’s gotta live.”\\n\\nThe question shot out without warning, but Raych was ready for it. “Planchet, sir.”\\n\\n“I agree. What’s your name?”\\n\\n“First or last name?”\\n\\n“Only name, as far as I know.”\\n\\n“You have no credits and, I gather, very little education.”\\n\\n',\n",
              " '“Afraid so.”\\n\\n“And no experience at any specialized job?”\\n\\n“I ain’t worked much, but I’m willing.”\\n\\n“All right. I’ll tell you what, Planchet.” He took a small white triangle out of his pocket \\nand pressed it in such a way as to produce a printed message on it. Then he rubbed his \\nthumb across it, freezing it. “I’ll tell you where to go. You take this with you and it may \\nget you a job.”\\n\\nRaych took the card and glanced at it. The signals seemed to fluoresce, but Raych could \\nnot read them. He looked at the other man warily. “What if they think I stole it?”\\n\\n“It can’t be stolen. It has my sign on it and now it has your name.”\\n\\n“What if they ask me who you are?”\\n\\n“They won’t. --You say you want a job. There’s your chance. I don’t guarantee it, but \\nthere’s your chance.” He gave him another card. “This is where to go.” Raych could read \\nthis one.\\n\\n“Thank you,” he mumbled.\\n\\nThe man made little dismissing gestures with his hand.\\n\\nRaych rose and left--and wondered what he was getting into.\\n\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\n 13\\n\\n      Up and down. Up and down. Up and down.\\n\\nGleb Andorin watched Gambol Deen Namarti trudging up and down.

He has to be held back \\n\\n',\n",

He turned \\naround and said, “If you’re going to lecture me again on Kaspalov, don’t bother.”\\n\\nAndorin shrugged lightly. “Why bother lecturing you? The deed is done. The harm--if \\nany--has been done.”\\n\\n“What harm, Andorin? What harm? If I had not done it,then we would have been \\nharmed. The man was on the edge of being a traitor. Within a month, he would have \\ngone running “\\n\\n“I know. I was there. I heard what he said.”\\n\\n“Then you understand there was no choice. No choice. You don’t think I liked to have an \\nold comrade killed, do you? I had no choice.”\\n\\nNamarti resumed his tramping, then turned again. “Andorin, do you believe in gods?”\\n\\n“Very well. You had no choice.”\\n\\nAndorin stared, “In what?”\\n\\n“In gods.”\\n\\n“I never heard the word. What is it?”\\n\\nNamarti said, “It’s not Galactic Standard. Supernatural influences. How’s that?”\\n\\n“Oh, supernatural influences. Why didn’t you say so? No, I don’t believe in that sort of \\nthing. By definition, something is supernatural if it exists outside the laws of nature and \\nnothing exists outside the laws of nature. Are you turning into a mystic?” Andorin asked \\nit as though he were joking, but his eyes narrowed with sudden concern.\\n\\nNamarti stared him down. Those blazing eyes of his could stare anyone down. “Don’t be \\na fool. I’ve been reading about it. Trillions of people believe in supernatural influences.”\\n\\n“I know,” said Andorin. “They always have.”\\n\\n“They’ve done so since before the beginning of history. The word ‘gods’ is of unknown \\n\\n',\n",
              " 'origin. It is, apparently, a hangover from some primeval language of which no trace any \\nlonger exists, except that word. --Do you know how many different varieties of beliefs \\nthere are in various kinds of gods?”\\n\\n“Approximately as many as the varieties of fools among the Galactic population, I \\nshould say.”\\n\\nNamarti ignored that. “Some people think the word dates back to the time when all \\nhumanity existed on but a single world.”\\n\\n“Itself a mythological concept. That’s just as lunatic as the notion of supernatural \\ninfluences. There never was one original human world.”\\n\\n“There would have to be, Andorin,” said Namarti, annoyed. “Human beings can’t have \\nevolved on different worlds and ended as a single species.”\\n\\n“Even so, there’s noeffective human world. It can’t be located, it can’t he defined, so it \\ncan’t be spoken of sensibly, so iteffectively doesn’t exist.”\\n\\n“These gods,” said Namarti, continuing to follow his own line of thought, “are supposed \\nto protect humanity and keep it safe or at least to care for those portions of humanity that \\nknow how to make use of the gods. At a time when there was only one human world, it \\nmakes sense to suppose they would be particularly interested in caring for that one tiny \\nworld with a few people. They would care for such a world as though they were big \\nbrothers--or parents.”\\n\\n“Very nice of them. I’d like to see them try to handle the entire Empire.”\\n\\n“What if they could? What if they were infinite?”\\n\\n“What if the Sun were frozen? What’s the use of ‘what if?”\\n\\n“I’m just speculating. Just thinking. Haven’t you ever let your mind wander freely? Do \\nyou always keep everything on a leash?”\\n\\n“I should imagine that’s the safest way, keeping it on a leash. What does your wandering \\nmind tell you, Chief?”\\n\\nNamarti’s eyes flashed at the other, as though he suspected sarcasm, but Andorin’s face \\nremained good-natured and blank.\\n\\nNamarti said, “What my mind is telling me is this-- If there are gods, they must be on \\n\\n',\n",
              " 'our side.”\\n\\n“Wonderful--if true. Where’s the evidence?”\\n\\n“Evidence? Without the gods, it would just be a coincidence, I suppose, but a very useful \\none.” Suddenly Namarti yawned and sat down, looking exhausted.\\n\\nGood, thought Andorin. His galloping mind has finally wound itself down and he may \\ntalk sense now.\\n\\n“This matter of internal breakdown of the infrastructure--” said Namarti, his voice \\ndistinctly lower.\\n\\nAndorin interrupted. “You know, Chief, Kaspalov was not entirely wrong about this. The \\nlonger we keep it up, the greater the chance that Imperial forces will discover the cause. \\nThe whole program must, sooner or later, explode in our faces.”\\n\\n“Not yet. So far, everything is exploding in the Imperial face. The unrest on Trantor is \\nsomething I can feel.” He raised his hands, rubbing his fingers together. “I can feel it. \\nAnd weare almost through. We are ready for the next step.”\\n\\nAndorin smiled humorlessly. “I’m not asking for details, Chief. Kaspalov did and look \\nwhere that got him. I am not Kaspalov.”\\n\\n“It’s precisely because you’re not Kaspalov that I can tell you. And because I know \\nsomething now I didn’t then.”\\n\\n“I presume,” said Andorin, only half-believing what he was saying, “that you intend a \\nstrike on the Imperial Palace grounds.”\\n\\nNamarti looked up. “Of course. What else is there to do? The problem, however, is how \\nto penetrate the grounds effectively. I have my sources of information there, but they are \\nonly spies. I’ll need men of action on the spot.”\\n\\n“To get men of action into the most heavily guarded region in all the galaxy will not be \\neasy.”\\n\\n“Of course not. That’s what has been giving me an unbearable headache till now--and \\nthen the gods intervened.”\\n\\nAndorin said gently (it was taking all his self-restraint to keep from showing his \\ndisgust), “I don’t think we need a metaphysical discussion. What has happened--leaving \\n\\n',\n",
              " 'the gods to one side?”\\n\\n“My information is that His Gracious and Ever to Be Beloved Emperor Cleon I has \\ndecided to appoint a new Chief Gardener. This is the first new appointee in nearly a \\nquarter of a century.”\\n\\n“And if so?”\\n\\n“Do you see no significance?”\\n\\nAndorin thought for a moment. “I am not a favorite of your gods. I don’t see any \\nsignificance.”\\n\\n“If you have a new Chief Gardener, Andorin, the situation is the same as having a new \\nadministrator of any other type--the same as if you had a new First Minister or a new \\nEmperor. The new Chief Gardener will certainly want his own staff. He will force into \\nretirement what he considers dead wood and will hire younger gardeners by the \\nhundreds.”\\n\\n“That’s possible.”\\n\\n“It’s more than possible. It’s certain. Exactly that happened when the present Chief \\nGardener was appointed and the same when his predecessor was appointed and so on. \\nHundreds of strangers from the Outer Worlds--”\\n\\n“Why from the Outer Worlds?”\\n\\n“Use your brains--if you have any, Andorin. What do Trantorians know about gardening \\nwhen they’ve lived under domes all their lives, tending potted plants, zoos, and carefully \\narranged crops of grains and fruit trees? What do they know about life in the wild?”\\n\\n“Ahhh. Now I understand.”\\n\\n“So there will be these strangers flooding the grounds. They will be carefully checked, I \\npresume, but they won’t be as tightly screened as they would be if they were \\nTrantorians. And that means, surely, that we should be able to supply just a few of our \\nown people, with false identifications, and get them inside. Even if some are screened \\nout, a few might make it--a few must make it. Our people will enter, despite the \\nsupertight security established since the failed coup in the early days of First Minister \\nSeldon.” (He virtually spat out the name, as he always did.) “We’ll finally have our \\nchance.”\\n\\n',\n",
              " 'Now it was Andorin who felt dizzy, as if he’d fallen into a spinning vortex. “It seems \\nodd for me to say so, Chief, but there is something to this ‘gods’ business after all, \\nbecause I have been waiting to tell you something that I now see fits in perfectly.”\\n\\nNamarti stared at the other suspiciously and looked around the room, as though he \\nsuddenly feared for security. But such fear was groundless. The room was located deep \\nin an old-fashioned residential complex and was well shielded. No one could overhear \\nand no one, even with detailed directions, could find it easily--nor get through the layers \\nof protection provided by loyal members of the organization.\\n\\nNamarti said, “What are you talking about?”\\n\\n“I’ve found a man for you. A young man--very naive. A quite likable fellow, the kind \\nyou feel you can trust as soon as you see him. He’s got an open face, wide-open eyes; \\nhe’s lived in Dahl; he’s an enthusiast for equality; he thinks Joranum was the greatest \\nthing since Dahlite cokeicers; and I’m sure we can easily talk him into doing anything \\nfor the cause.”\\n\\n“For the cause?” said Namarti, whose suspicions were not in the least alleviated. “Is he \\none of us?”\\n\\n“Actually, he’s not one of anything. He’s got some vague notions in his head that \\nJoranum wanted sector equality.”\\n\\n“That was his lure. Sure.”\\n\\n“It’s ours, too, but the kidbelieves it. He talks about equality and popular participation in \\ngovernment. He even mentioned democracy.”\\n\\nNamarti snickered. “In twenty thousand years, democracy has never been used for very \\nlong without falling apart.”\\n\\n“Yes, but that’s not our concern. It’s what drives the young man and I tell you, Chief, I \\nknew we had our tool just about the moment I saw him, but I didn’t know how we could \\npossibly use him. Now I know. We can get him onto the Imperial Palace grounds as a \\ngardener.”\\n\\n“How? Does he know anything about gardening?”\\n\\n“No. I’m sure he doesn’t. He’s never worked at anything but unskilled labor. He’s \\noperating a hauler right now and I think that he had to be taught how to do that. Still, if \\nwe can get him in as a gardener’s helper, if he just knows how to hold a pair of shears, \\n\\n',\n",
              " 'then we’ve got it.”\\n\\n“Got what?”\\n\\n“Got someone who can approach anyone we wish--and do so without raising the flutter \\nof a suspicion--and get close enough to strike. I’m telling you he simply exudes a kind \\nof honorable stupidity, a kind of foolish virtue that inspires confidence.”\\n\\n“And he’ll do what we tell him to do?”\\n\\n“Absolutely.”\\n\\n“How did you meet this person?”\\n\\n“It wasn’t I. It was Manella who really spotted him.”\\n\\n“Who?”\\n\\n“Manella. Manella Dubanqua.”\\n\\n“Oh. That friend of yours.” Namarti’s face twisted into a look of prissy disapproval.\\n\\n“She’s the friend of many people,” said Andorin tolerantly. “That’s one of the things that \\nmakes her so useful. She can weigh a man quickly and with very little to go on. She \\ntalked to this fellow because she was attracted to him at sight--and I assure you that \\nManella isnot one who is usually attracted by anything but the bottom line--so, you see, \\nthis man is rather unusual. She talked to this fellow--his name is Planchet, by the way--\\nand then told me, ‘I have a live one for you, Gleb.’ I’ll trust her on the matter of live \\nones any day of the week.”\\n\\nNamarti said slyly, “And what do you think this wonderful tool of yours would do once \\nhe had the run of the grounds, eh, Andorin?”\\n\\nAndorin took a deep breath. “What else? If we do everything right, he will dispose of \\nour dear Emperor Cleon, First of that Name, for us.”\\n\\nNamarti’s face blazed into anger. “What? Are you mad? Why should we want to kill \\nCleon? He’s our hold on the government. He’s the facade behind which we can rule. \\nHe’s our passport to legitimacy. Where are your brains? We need him as a figurehead. \\nHe won’t interfere with us and we’ll be stronger for his existence.”\\n\\nAndorin’s fair face turned blotchy red and his good humor finally exploded. “What do \\n\\n',\n",
              " 'you have in mind, then? What are you planning? I’m getting tired of always having to \\nsecond-guess.”\\n\\nNamarti raised his hand. “All right. All right. Calm down. I meant no harm. But think a \\nbit, will you? Who destroyed Joranum? Who destroyed our hopes ten years ago? It was \\nthat mathematician. And it is he who rules the Empire now with his idiotic talk about \\npsychohistory. Cleon is nothing. It is Hari Seldon we must destroy. It is Hari Seldon \\nwhom I’ve been turning into an object of ridicule with these constant breakdowns. The \\nmiseries they entail are placed athis doorstep. It is all being interpreted ashis \\ninefficiency,his incapacity.” There was a trace of spittle in the corners of Namarti’s \\nmouth. “When he’s cut down, there will be a cheer from the Empire that will drown out \\nevery holovision report for hours. It won’t even matter if they know who did it.” He \\nraised his hand and let it drop, as if he were plunging a knife into someone’s heart. “We \\nwill be looked upon as heroes of the Empire, as saviors. --Eh? Eh? Do you think your \\nyoungster can cut down Hari Seldon?”\\n\\nAndorin had recovered his sense of equanimity--at least outwardly.\\n\\n“I’m sure he would,” he said with forced lightness. “For Cleon, he might have some \\nrespect; the Emperor has a mystical aura about him, as you know.” (He stressed the \\n“you” faintly and Namarti scowled.) “He would have no such feelings about Seldon.”\\n\\nInwardly, however, Andorin was furious. This was not what he wanted. He was being \\nbetrayed.\\n\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\n 14\\n\\n      Manella brushed the hair out of her eyes and smiled up at Raych. “I told you it \\nwouldn’t cost you any credits.”\\n\\nRaych blinked and scratched at his bare shoulder. “But are you going to ask me for some \\nnow?”\\n\\nShe shrugged and smiled rather impishly. “Why should I?”\\n\\n“Why shouldn’t you?”\\n\\n“Because I’m allowed to take my own pleasure sometimes.”\\n\\n',\n",

They think he has ambitions but is too much of a playboy to do anything about \\nthem.”\\n\\n“And is he involved with the Joranumites?”\\n\\nSeldon made an uncertain gesture. “I’m under the impression that the security \\nestablishment knows nothing about the Joranumites. That may mean that the \\nJoranumites no longer exist or that, if they do, they are of no importance. It may also \\nmean that the security establishment just isn’t interested. Nor is there any way in which I \\ncan force it to be interested. I’m only thankful the officers give me any information at \\nall. And I am the First Minister.”\\n\\n“Is it possible that you’re not a very good First Minister?” said Dors, dryly.\\n\\n“That’s more than possible. It’s probably been generations since there’s been an \\nappointee less suited to the job than myself. But that has nothing to do with the security \\nestablishment. It’s a totally independent arm of the government. I doubt that Cleon \\nhimself knows much about it, though, in theory, the security officers are supposed to \\nreport to him through their director. Believe me, if we only knew more about the \\nsecurity establishment, we’d be trying to stick its actions into our psychohistorical \\nequations, such as they are.”\\n\\n“Are the security officers on our side, at least?”\\n\\n“I believe so, but I can’t swear to it.”\\n\\n“And why are you interested in this what’s-his-name?”\\n\\n“Gleb Andorin. Because I received a roundabout message from Raych.”\\n\\nDors’s eyes flashed. “Why didn’t you tell me? Is he all right?”\\n\\n“As far as I know, but I hope he doesn’t try any further messages. If he’s caught \\ncommunicating, hewon’t be all right. In any case, he has made contact with Andorin.”\\n\\n“And the Joranumites, too?”\\n\\n“I don’t think so. It would sound unlikely, for the connection is not something that \\nwould make sense. The Joranumite movement is predominantly lower-class--a \\nproletarian movement, so to speak. And Andorin is an aristocrat of aristocrats. What \\nwould he be doing with the Joranumites?”\\n\\n',\n",
              " '“If he’s of the Wyan Mayoralty family, he might aspire to the Imperial throne, might he \\nnot?”\\n\\n“They’ve been aspiring for generations. You remember Rashelle, I trust. She was \\nAndorin’s aunt.”\\n\\n“Then he might be using the Joranumites as a stepping-stone, don’t you think?”\\n\\n“If they exist. And if they do--and if a stepping-stone is what Andorin wants--I think \\nhe’d find himself playing a dangerous game. The Joranumites--if they exist--would have \\ntheir own plans and a man like Andorin may find he’s simply riding a greti--”\\n\\n“What’s a greti?”\\n\\n“Some extinct animal of a ferocious type, I think. It’s just a proverbial phrase back on \\nHelicon. If you ride a greti, you find you can’t get off, for then it will eat you.”\\n\\nSeldon paused. “One more thing. Raych seems to be involved with a woman who knows \\nAndorin and through whom, he thinks, he may get important information. I’m telling \\nyou this now so that you won’t accuse me afterward of keeping anything from you.”\\n\\nDors frowned. “A woman?”\\n\\n“One, I gather, who knows a great many men who will talk to her unwisely, sometimes, \\nunder intimate circumstances.”\\n\\n“One ofthose .” Her frown deepened. “I don’t like the thought of Raych--”\\n\\n“Come, come. Raych is thirty years old and undoubtedly has much experience. You can \\nleave this woman--or any woman, I think--safely to Raych’s good sense.” He turned \\ntoward Dors with a look so worn, so weary, and said, “Do you think I like this? Do you \\nthink I likeany of this?”\\n\\nAnd Dors could find nothing to say.\\n\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\n 16\\n\\n      Gambol Deen Namarti was not, at even the best of times, noted for his politeness \\n\\n',\n",

Where is he?”\\n\\nAndorin shrugged. “But I’m here.”\\n\\n“He’ll be here eventually.”\\n\\n“Why not now?”\\n\\nAndorin’s rather handsome head seemed to sink a bit, as though he were lost in thought \\nor coming to a decision, and then he said abruptly, “I don’t want to bring him until I \\nknow where I stand.”\\n\\n“What does that mean?”\\n\\n“Simple words in Galactic Standard. How long has it been your aim to get rid of Hari \\nSeldon?”\\n\\n“Always! Always! Is that so hard to understand? We deserve revenge for what he did to \\nJo-Jo. Even if he hadn’t done that, since he’s the First Minister, we’d have to put him out \\nof the way.”\\n\\n“But it’s Cleon--Cleon--who must be brought down. If not only he, then at least he, in \\naddition to Seldon.”\\n\\n“Why does a figurehead concern you?”\\n\\n“You weren’t born yesterday. I’ve never had to explain my part in this because you’re \\nnot so ignorant a fool as not to know. What can I possibly care about your plans if they \\ndon’t include a replacement on the throne?”\\n\\nNamarti laughed. “Of course. I’ve known for a long time that you look upon me as your \\nfootstool, your way of climbing up to the Imperial throne.”\\n\\n“Would you expect anything else?”\\n\\n“Not at all.

Won’t I be”--and his face twisted with irony as he spat out the \\nwords--”the new figurehead?”\\n\\n“Is that what you plan to be? A figurehead?”\\n\\n“I plan to be the Emperor. I supplied advances of credit when you had none. I supplied \\nthe cadre when you had none. I supplied the respectability you needed to build a large \\norganization here in Wye. I can still withdraw everything I’ve brought in.”\\n\\n“I don’t think so.”\\n\\n“Do you want to risk it? Don’t think you can treat me the way you treated Kaspalov, \\neither. If anything happens to me, Wye will become uninhabitable for you and yours--\\nand you will find that no other sector will supply you with what you need.”\\n\\nNamarti sighed. “Then you insist on having the Emperor killed.”\\n\\n“I didn’t say ‘killed.’ I said ‘brought down.’ The details I leave to you.” This last \\nstatement was accompanied with an almost dismissive wave of the hand, a flick of the \\nwrist, as if Andorin were already sitting on the Imperial throne.\\n\\n“And then you’ll be Emperor?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“No, you won’t. You’ll be dead--and not at my hands, either. Andorin, let me teach you \\nsome of the facts of life. If Cleon is killed, then the matter of the succession comes up \\nand, to avoid civil war, the Imperial Guard will at once kill every member of the Wyan \\nMayoral family they can find--you first of all. On the other hand, if only the First \\nMinister is killed, you will be safe.”\\n\\n“Why?”\\n\\n“A First Minister is only a First Minister. They come and go. It is possible that Cleon \\nhimself may have grown tired of him and arranged the murder. Certainly we would see \\nto it that rumors of this sort are spread. The Imperial Guard would hesitate and would \\ngive us a chance to put the new government into place. Indeed, it is quite possible that \\nthey themselves would be grateful for the end of Seldon.”\\n\\n',\n",
              " '“And with the new government in place, what am I to do? Keep on waiting? Forever?”\\n\\n“No. Once I’m First Minister, there will be ways of dealing with Cleon. I may even be \\nable to do something with the Imperial Guard--and even with the security \\nestablishment--and use them all as my instruments. I will then manage to find some safe \\nway of getting rid of Cleon and replacing him with you.”\\n\\nAndorin burst out, “Why should you?”\\n\\nNamarti said, “What do you mean, why should I?”\\n\\n“You have a personal grudge against Seldon. Once he is gone, why should you run \\nunnecessary risks at the highest level? You will make your peace with Cleon and I will \\nhave to retire to my crumbling estate and my impossible dreams. And perhaps, to play it \\nsafe, you will have me killed.”\\n\\nNamarti said, “No! Cleon was born to the throne. He comes from several generations of \\nEmperors--the proud Entun Dynasty. He would he very difficult to handle, a plague. \\nYou, on the other hand, would come to the throne as a member of a new dynasty, \\nwithout any strong ties to tradition, for the previous Wyan Emperors were, you will \\nadmit, totally undistinguished. You will be seated on a shaky throne and will need \\nsomeone to support you--me. And I will need someone who is dependent upon me and \\nwhom I can therefore handle--you. --Come, Andorin, ours is not a marriage of love, \\nwhich fades in a year; it is a marriage of convenience, which can last as long as we both \\nlive. Let us trust each other.”\\n\\n“You swear I will be Emperor.”\\n\\n“What good would swearing do if you couldn’t trust my word? Let us say I would find \\nyou an extraordinarily useful Emperor and I would want you to replace Cleon as soon as \\nthat can safely be managed. Now introduce me to this man you think will be the perfect \\ntool for your purposes.”\\n\\n“Very well. And remember what makes him different. I have studied him. He’s a not-\\nvery-bright idealist. He will do what he’s told, unconcerned by danger, unconcerned by \\nsecond thoughts. And he exudes a kind of trustworthiness so that his victim will trust \\nhim, even if he has a blaster in his hand.”\\n\\n“I find that impossible to believe.”\\n\\n“Wait till you meet him,” said Andorin.\\n\\n',\n",

He had met the man ten years before, when Raych had been sent to lure Jo-Jo \\nJoranum to his destruction, and one look was more than enough.\\n\\nNamarti had changed little in ten years. Anger and hatred were still the dominant \\ncharacteristics one could see in him--or that Raych could see in him, at any rate, for he \\nrealized he was not an impartial witness--and those seemed to have marinated him into \\nleathery permanence. His face was a trifle more gaunt, his hair was flecked with gray, \\nbut his thin-lipped mouth was set in the same harsh line and his dark eyes were as \\nbrilliantly dangerous as ever.\\n\\nThat was enough and Raych kept his eyes averted. Namarti, he felt, was not the type of \\nperson who would take to someone who could stare lm straight in the face.\\n\\nNamarti seemed to devour Raych with his own eyes, but the slight sneer his face always \\nseemed to wear remained.\\n\\nHe turned to Andorin, who stood uneasily to one side, and said, quite ;is though the \\nsubject of conversation were not present, “This is the man, then.”\\n\\nAndorin nodded and his lips moved in a soundless “Yes, Chief.”\\n\\nNamarti said to Raych abruptly, “Your name.”\\n\\n“Planchet, sir.”\\n\\n“You believe in our cause?”\\n\\n“Yes, sir.” He spoke carefully, in accordance with Andorin’s instructions. “I am a \\ndemocrat and want greater participation of the people in the governmental process.”\\n\\nNamarti’s eyes flicked in Andorin’s direction. “A speechmaker.”\\n\\nHe looked back at Raych. “Are you willing to undertake risks for the cause?”\\n\\n',\n",
              " '“Any risk, sir.”\\n\\n“You will do as you are told? No questions? No hanging back?”\\n\\n“I will follow orders.”\\n\\n“Do you know anything about gardening?”\\n\\nRaych hesitated. “No, sir.”\\n\\n“You’re a Trantorian, then? Born under the dome?”\\n\\n“I was born in Millimaru, sir, and I was brought up in Dahl.”\\n\\n“Very well,” said Namarti. Then to Andorin, “Take him out and deliver him temporarily \\nto the men waiting there. They will take good care of him. Then come back, Andorin. I \\nwant to speak to you.”\\n\\nWhen Andorin returned, a profound change had come over Namarti. Ibis eyes were \\nglittering and his mouth was twisted into a feral grin.\\n\\n“Andorin,” he said, “the gods we spoke of the other day are with us to an extent I \\ncouldn’t have imagined.”\\n\\n“I told you the man was suitable for our purposes.”\\n\\n“Far more suitable than you think. You know, of course, the tale of how Hari Seldon our \\nrevered First Minister, sent his son--or foster son, rather--to see Joranum and to set the \\ntrap into which Joranum, against my advice, fell.”\\n\\n“Yes,” said Andorin, nodding wearily, “I know the story.” He said it with the air of one \\nwho knew the story entirely too well.\\n\\n“I saw that boy only that once, but his image burned into my brain. Do you suppose that \\nten years’ passage and false heels and a shaved mustache could fool me? That Planchet \\nof yours is Raych, the foster son of Hari Seldon.”\\n\\nAndorin paled and held his breath for a moment. He said, “Are you sure of that, Chief?”\\n\\n“As sure as I am that you’re standing here in front of me and that you have introduced \\nan enemy into our midst.”\\n\\n',\n",
              " '“I had no idea--”\\n\\n“Don’t get nervous,” said Namarti. “I consider it the best thing you have ever done in \\nyour idle aristocratic life. You have played the role that the gods have marked out for \\nyou. If I had not known who he was, he might have fulfilled the function for which he \\nwas undoubtedly intended: to be a spy in our midst and an informant of our most secret \\nplans. But since I know who he is, it won’t work that way.

Maybe he means you’ll get a better job.”\\n\\nRaych stiffened. “What kind of work? Did he mention anything in particular?”\\n\\n“No, but he said he would be going to the Imperial Sector.”\\n\\n“Did he? Does he often tell you things like that?”\\n\\n“You know how it is, Planchet. When a fellow’s in bed with you, he talks a lot.”\\n\\n“I know,” said Raych, who was always careful not to. “What else does he say?”\\n\\n“Why do you ask?” She frowned a bit. “He always asks about you, too.

Of course, I’d like to go to the \\nImperial Sector--if he’d take me. I’ve never been there.”\\n\\nRaych almost slipped, but he managed to cough, then said, “I’ve never been there, \\neither.”\\n\\n“It’s got the biggest buildings and the nicest places and the fanciest restaurants--and \\nthat’s where the rich people live. I’d like to meet some rich people--besides Gleb, I \\nmean.”\\n\\nRaych said, “I suppose there’s not much you can get out of a person like me.”\\n\\n“You’re all right. You can’t think of credits all the time, but you’ve got to think of them \\nsome of the time. Especially since I think Gleb is getting tired of me.”\\n\\nRaych felt compelled to say, “No one could get tired of you,” and then found, a little to \\nhis own confusion, that he meant it.\\n\\nManella said, “That’s what men always say, but you’d be surprised. Anyway, it’s been \\ngood, you and I, Planchet. Take care of yourself and, who knows, we may see each other \\nagain.”\\n\\nRaych nodded and found himself at a loss for words. There was no way in which he \\ncould say or do anything to express his feelings.\\n\\nHe turned his mind in other directions. He had to find out what the Namarti people were \\nplanning. If they were separating him from Manella, the crisis must be rapidly \\napproaching. All he had to go on was that odd question about gardening.\\n\\nNor could he get any further information back to Seldon. He had been kept under close \\nscrutiny since his meeting with Namarti and all avenues of communication were cut \\noff--surely another indication of an approaching crisis.\\n\\nBut if he were to find out what was going on only after it was done--and if he could \\ncommunicate the news only after it was no longer news--he would have failed.\\n\\n  \\n\\n',\n",

He had not heard from Raych since his first \\ncommunique; he had no idea what was happening.\\n\\nAside from his natural concern for Raych’s safety (surely he would hear if something \\nreally bad had happened), there was his uneasiness over what might be planned.\\n\\nIt would have to be subtle. A direct attack on the Palace itself was totally out of the \\nquestion. Security there was far too tight. But if so, what else could be planned that \\nwould be sufficiently effective?\\n\\nThe whole thing was keeping him awake at night and distracted by day.\\n\\nThe signal light flashed.\\n\\n“First Minister. Your two o’clock appointment, sir--”\\n\\n“What two o’clock appointment is this?”\\n\\n“Mandell Gruber, the gardener. He has the necessary certification.”\\n\\nSeldon remembered. “Yes. Send him in.”\\n\\nThis was no time to see Gruber, but he had agreed to it in a moment of weakness--the \\nman had seemed distraught. A First Minister should not have such moments of \\nweakness, but Seldon had been Seldon long before he had become First :Minister.\\n\\n“Come in, Gruber,” he said kindly.\\n\\nGruber stood before him, head ducking mechanically, eyes darting this way and that. \\nSeldon was quite certain the gardener had never been in any room as magnificent as this \\none and he had the bitter urge to say: “Do you like it? Please take it.I don’t want it.”\\n\\nBut he only said, “What is it, Gruber? Why are you so unhappy”\\n\\nThere was no immediate answer; Gruber merely smiled vacantly.\\n\\nSeldon said, “Sit down, man. Right there in that chair.”\\n\\n',\n",
              " '“Oh no, First Minister. It would not be fitting. I’ll get it dirty.”\\n\\n“If you do, it will be easy to clean. Do as I say. --Good!

The blessed Emperor himself told me so.”\\n\\n“Yes, I have heard of that, but that surely isn’t what is troubling you. Your new post is a \\nmatter of congratulations and I do congratulate you. I may even have contributed to it, \\nGruber. I have never forgotten your bravery at the time I was nearly killed and you can \\nbe sure I mentioned it to His Imperial Majesty. It is a suitable reward, Gruber, and you \\nwould deserve the promotion in any case, for it is quite clear from your record that you \\nare fully qualified for the post. So, now that that’s out of the way, tell me what is \\ntroubling you.”\\n\\n“First Minister, it is the very post and promotion that’s troubling me. It is something I \\ncannot manage, for I am not qualified.”\\n\\n“We are convinced you are.”\\n\\nGruber grew agitated. “And is it in an office I will have to sit? I can’t sit in an office. I \\ncould not go out in the open air and work with the plants and animals. I would be in \\nprison, First Minister.”\\n\\nSeldon’s eyes opened wide. “No such thing, Gruber. You needn’t stay in the office \\nlonger than you have to. You could wander around the grounds freely, supervising \\neverything. You will have all the outdoors you want and you will merely spare yourself \\nthe hard work.”\\n\\n“I want the hard work, First Minister, and it’s no chance at all they will let me come out \\nof the office. I have watched the present Chief Gardener. He couldn’t leave his office, \\nthough he wanted to, ever so. There is too much administration, too much bookkeeping. \\nSure, if he wants to know what is going on, we must go to his office to tell him. He \\nwatches things onholovision” --he said with infinite contempt “as though you can tell \\nanything about growing, living things from pictures. It is not for me, First Minister.”\\n\\n“Come, Gruber, be a man. It’s not all that bad. You’ll get used to it.

I’ll tell you \\nthat right now I wish I were not First Minister. This job is too much for me. I even have \\na notion that there are times when the Emperor himself is tired of his Imperial robes. \\nWe’re all in this Galaxy to do our work and the work isn’t always pleasant.”\\n\\n“I understand that, First Minister, but the Emperor must be Emperor, for he was born to \\nthat. And you must be First Minister, for there is no one else who can do the job. But in \\nmy case, it is just Chief Gardener we are ruminating upon. There are fifty gardeners in \\nthe place who could do it as well as I could and who wouldn’t mind the office. You say \\nthat you spoke to the Emperor about how I tried to help you. Can’t you speak to him \\nagain and explain that if he wants to reward me for what I did, he can leave me as I \\nam?”\\n\\nSeldon leaned back in his chair and said solemnly, “Gruber, I would do that for you if I \\ncould, but I must explain something to you and I can only hope that you will understand \\nit. The Emperor, in theory, is absolute ruler of the Empire. In actual fact, there is very \\nlittle he can do. I run the Empire right now much more than he does and there is very \\nlittle I can do, too. There are millions and billions of people at all levels of government, \\nall making decisions, all making mistakes, some acting wisely and heroically, some \\nacting foolishly and thievishly. There’s no controlling them. Do you understand me, \\nGruber?”\\n\\n“I do, but what has this to do with my case?”\\n\\n“Because there is only one place where the Emperor is really absolute ruler--and that is \\nover the Imperial grounds. Here, his word is law and the layers of officials beneath him \\nare few enough for him to handle. For him to be asked to rescind a decision he has made \\nin connection with the Imperial Palace grounds would be to invade the only area that he \\nwould consider inviolate. If I were to say, ‘Take back your decision on Gruber, Your \\nImperial Majesty,’ he would be much more likely to relieve me of my duties than to take \\nback his decision. That might be a good thing for me, but it wouldn’t help you any.”\\n\\nGruber said, “Does that mean there’s no way things can be changed?”\\n\\n“That’s exactly what it means. But don’t worry, Gruber, I’ll help you all I can. I’m sorry. \\nBut now I have really spent all the time with you that I am able to spare.”\\n\\nGruber rose to his feet. In his hands he twisted his green gardening cap. There was more \\nthan a suspicion of tears in his eyes. “Thank you, First Minister. I know you would like \\n\\n',\n",
              " 'to help. You’re--you’re a good man, First Minister.”\\n\\nHe turned and left, sorrowing.\\n\\nSeldon looked after him thoughtfully and shook his head. Multiply Gruber’s woes by a \\nquadrillion and you would have the woes of all the people of the twenty-five million \\nworlds of the Empire and how was he, Seldon, to work out salvation for all of them, \\nwhen he was helpless to solve the problem of one single man who had come to him for \\nhelp?\\n\\nPsychohistory could not save one man. Could it save a quadrillion?\\n\\nHe shook his head again, checked the nature and time of his next appointment, and then \\nsuddenly stiffened. He shouted into his communications wire in sudden wild abandon, \\nquite unlike his usually strict control. “Get that gardener back! Get him back here right \\nnow!”\\n\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\n 20\\n\\n      “What’s this about new gardeners?” exclaimed Seldon. This time he did not ask \\nGruber to sit down.\\n\\nGruber’s eyes blinked rapidly. He was in a panic at having been recalled so \\nunexpectedly. “N-new g-gardeners?” he stammered.\\n\\n“You said ‘all the new gardeners.’ Those were your words.What new gardeners?”\\n\\nGruber was astonished. “Sure, if there is a new Chief Gardener, there will be new \\ngardeners. It is the custom.”\\n\\n“I have never heard of this.”\\n\\n“But what’s it all about?”\\n\\n“The last time we had a change of Chief Gardeners, you were not First Minister. It is \\nlikely you were not even on Trantor.”\\n\\n“Well, gardeners are never discharged. Some die. Some grow too old and are pensioned \\n\\n',\n",
              " 'off and replaced. Still, by the time a new Chief Gardener is ready for his duties, at least \\nhalf the staff is aged and beyond their best years.

There are almost five hundred square \\nkilometers in the gardens and parklands and it usually takes some years to reorganize it \\nand it is myself who will have to supervise it all. Please, First Minister.” Gruber was \\ngasping. “Surely a clever man like your own self can find a way to change the blessed \\nEmperor’s mind.”\\n\\nSeldon paid no attention. His forehead was creased in concentration. “Where do the new \\ngardeners come from?”\\n\\n“There are examinations on all the worlds--there are always people waiting to serve as \\nreplacements. They’ll be coming in by the hundreds in a dozen batches. It will take me a \\nyear, at the least--”\\n\\n“From where do they come? From where?”\\n\\n“From any of a million worlds. We want a variety of horticultural knowledge. Any \\ncitizen of the Empire can qualify.”\\n\\n“From Trantor, too?”\\n\\n“No, not from Trantor. There is no one from Trantor in the gardens.” His voice grew \\ncontemptuous. “You can’t get a gardener out of Trantor. The parks they have here under \\nthe dome aren’t gardens. They are potted plants and the animals are in cages. \\nTrantorians, poor specimens that they are, know nothing about open air, free water, and \\nthe true balance of nature.”\\n\\n“All right, Gruber. I will now give you a job. It will be up to you to get me the names of \\nevery new gardener scheduled to arrive over the coming weeks. Everything about them. \\nName. World. Reference number. Education. Experience. Everything. I want it all here \\non my desk just as quickly as possible. I’m going to send people to help you. People \\nwith machines. What kind of a computer do you use?”\\n\\n“Only a simple one for keeping track of plantings and species and things like that.”\\n\\n“All right. The people I send will be able to do anything you can’t do. I can’t tell you \\n\\n',\n",

Instead, you will be discharged without a pension.”\\n\\nAlone again, Seldon barked into his communication wire, “Cancel all appointments for \\nthe rest of the afternoon.”\\n\\nHe then let his body flop in his chair, feeling every bit of his fifty years and feeling his \\nheadache worsen. For years, for decades, security had been built up around the Imperial \\nPalace grounds, thicker, more solid, more impenetrable, as each new layer and each new \\ndevice was added.\\n\\n--and every once in a while, hordes of strangers were let into the grounds. No questions \\nasked, probably, but one: “Can you garden?”\\n\\nThe stupidity involved was too colossal to grasp.\\n\\nAnd he had barely caught it in time. Or had he? Was he, even now, too late?\\n\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\n 21\\n\\n      Gleb Andorin gazed at Namarti through half-closed eyes. He never liked the man, \\nbut there were times when he liked him less than he usually did and this was one of \\nthose times. Why should Andorin, a Wyan of royal birth (that’s what it amounted to, \\nafter all) have to work with this parvenu, this near-psychotic paranoid?\\n\\nAndorin knew why and he had to endure, even when Namarti was once again in the \\nprocess of telling the story of how he had built up the movement during a period of ten \\nyears to its present pitch of perfection. Did he tell this to everyone, over and over? Or \\nwas it just Andorin who was his chosen vessel?\\n\\nNamarti’s face seemed to shine with malignant glee as he said, in an odd singsong, as \\nthough it were a matter of rote, “Year after year. I worked on those lines, even through \\nhopelessness and uselessness, building an organization, chipping away at confidence in \\nthe government, creating and intensifying dissatisfaction. When there was the banking \\n\\n',\n",

Namarti was not such an idiot as not to \\nknow what a bore he was; he just couldn’t help it. Andorin said, “You’ve told me this \\nmany times.” He allowed the remainder of the question to hang in the air, unanswered. \\nThe answer, after all, was an obvious affirmative. There was no need to face him with it.\\n\\nA slight flush crossed Namarti’s sallow face. He said, “But it could have gone on \\nforever--the building, the chipping, without ever coming to a point--if I hadn’t had the \\nproper tool in my hands. And without any effort on my part, the tool came to me.”\\n\\n“The gods brought you Planchet,” said Andorin neutrally.\\n\\n“You’re right. There will be a group of gardeners entering the Imperial Palace grounds \\nsoon.” He paused and seemed to savor the thought.\\n\\n“Men and women. Enough to serve as a mask for the handful of our operatives who will \\naccompany them. Among them will be you--and Planchet. And what will make you and \\nPlanchet unusual is that you will be carrying blasters.”\\n\\n“Surely,” said Andorin with deliberate malice behind a polite expression, “we’ll be \\nstopped at the gates and held for questioning. Bringing an illicit blaster onto the Palace \\ngrounds--”\\n\\n“You won’t be stopped,” said Namarti, missing the malice. “You won’t be searched. \\nThat’s been arranged. You will all be greeted as a matter of course by some Palace \\nofficial. I don’t know who would ordinarily be in charge of that task--the Third Assistant \\nChamberlain in Charge of Grass and Leaves, for all I know--but in this case, it will be \\nSeldon himself. The great mathematician will hurry out to greet the new gardeners and \\nwelcome them to the grounds.”\\n\\n“You’re sure of that, I suppose.”\\n\\n“Of course, I am. It’s all been arranged. He will learn, at more or less the last minute, \\nthat his foster son is among those listed as new gardeners and it will be impossible for \\nhim to refrain from coming out to see him. And when Seldon appears, Planchet will \\nraise his blaster. Our people will raise the cry of ‘Treason!’ In the confusion and hurly-\\nburly, Planchet will kill Seldon and then you will kill Planchet. You will then drop your \\nblaster and leave. There are those who will help you leave. It’s been arranged.”\\n\\n',\n",
              " '“Is it absolutely necessary to kill Planchet?”\\n\\nNamarti frowned. “Why? Do you object to one killing and not to another? When \\nPlanchet recovers, do you wish him to tell the authorities all he knows about us? \\nBesides, this is a family feud we are arranging. Don’t forget that Planchet is, in actual \\nfact, Raych Seldon. It will look as though the two had fired simultaneously--or as though \\nSeldon had given orders that if his son made any hostile move, he was to be shot down. \\nWe will see to it that the family angle will be given full publicity. It will be reminiscent \\nof the bad old days of the Bloody Emperor Manowell. The people of Trantor will surely \\nbe repelled by the sheer wickedness of the deed. That, piled on top of all the \\ninefficiencies and breakdowns they’ve been witnessing and living through, will raise the \\ncry for a new government--and no one will be able to refuse them, least of all the \\nEmperor. And then we’ll step in.”\\n\\n“Just like that?”\\n\\n“No, not just like that. I don’t live in a dream world. There is likely to be some interim \\ngovernment, but it will fail. We’ll see to it that it fails and we’ll come out in the open \\nand revive the old Joranumite arguments that the Trantorians have never forgotten. And \\nin time--in not too much time--I will be First Minister.”\\n\\n“And I?”\\n\\n“Will eventually be the Emperor.”\\n\\nAndorin said, “The chance of all this working is small. --This is arranged. That is \\narranged. The other thing is arranged. All of it has to come together and mesh perfectly \\nor it will fail. Somewhere, someone is bound to mess up. It’s an unacceptable risk.”\\n\\n“Unacceptable? For whom? For you?”\\n\\n“Certainly. You expect me to make certain that Planchet will kill his father and you \\nexpect me to then kill Planchet. Why me? Aren’t there tools worth less than I who might \\nmore easily be risked?”\\n\\n“Yes, but to choose anyone else would make failure certain. Who but you has so much \\nriding on this mission that there is no chance you will turn back in a fit of vapors at the \\nlast minute?”\\n\\n“The risk is enormous.”\\n\\n',\n",
              " '“Isn’t it worth it to you? You’re playing for the Imperial throne.”\\n\\n“And what risk are you taking, Chief? You will remain here, quite comfortable, and wait \\nto hear the news.”\\n\\nNamarti’s lip curled. “What a fool you are, Andorin! What an Emperor you will make! \\nDo you suppose I take no risk because I will be here? If the gambit fails, if the plot \\nmiscarries, if some of our people are taken, do you think they won’t tell everything they \\nknow? If you were somehow caught, would you face the tender treatment of the \\nImperial Guard without ever telling them about me?\\n\\n“And with a failed assassination attempt at hand, do you suppose they won’t comb \\nTrantor to find me? Do you suppose that in the end they will fail to find me? And when \\nthey do find me, what do you suppose I will have to face at their hands? --Risk? I run a \\nworse risk than any of you, just sitting here doing nothing. It boils down to this, \\nAndorin. Do you or do you not wish to be Emperor?”\\n\\nAndorin said in a low voice, “I wish to be Emperor.” And so things were set in motion.\\n\\n 22\\n\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\n      Raych had no trouble seeing that he was being treated with special care. The whole \\ngroup of would-be gardeners was now quartered in one of the hotels in the Imperial \\nSector, although not one of the prime hotels, of course.\\n\\nThe gardeners were an odd lot, from fifty different worlds, but Raych had little chance to \\nspeak to any of them. Andorin, without being too obvious about it, had managed to keep \\nhim apart from the others.\\n\\nRaych wondered why. It depressed him. In fact, he had been feeling somewhat \\ndepressed since he had left Wye. It interfered with his thinking process and he fought it--\\nbut not with entire success.\\n\\nAndorin was himself wearing rough clothes and was attempting to look like a workman. \\nHe would be playing the part of a gardener as a way of running the “show”--whatever \\nthe “show” might be.\\n\\nRaych felt ashamed that he had not been able to penetrate the nature of that “show.” \\n\\n',\n",
              " 'They had closed in on him and prevented all communication, so he hadn’t even had the \\nchance to warn his father. They might be doing this for every Trantorian who had been \\npushed into the group, for all he knew, just as an extreme precaution. Raych estimated \\nthat there might be a dozen Trantorians among them, all of them Namarti’s people, of \\ncourse, men and women both.\\n\\nWhat puzzled him was that Andorin treated him with what was almost affection. He \\nmonopolized him, insisted on having all his meals with him, treated him quite \\ndifferently from the way in which he treated anyone else.\\n\\nCould it be because they had shared Manella? Raych did not know enough about the \\nmores of the Wye Sector to be able to tell whether there might not be a polyandrous \\ntouch to their society. If two men shared a woman, did that make them, in a way, \\nfraternal? Did it create a bond?\\n\\nRaych had never heard of such a thing, but he knew better than to suppose he had a \\ngrasp of even a tiny fraction of the infinite subtleties of galactic societies--even of \\nTrantorian societies.\\n\\nBut now that his mind had brought him back to Manella, he dwelled on her for a while. \\nHe missed her terribly and it occurred to him that missing her might be the cause of his \\ndepression, though, to tell the truth, what he was feeling now, as he was finishing lunch \\nwith Andorin, was almost despair--though he could think of no cause for it.\\n\\nManella!\\n\\nShe had said she wanted to visit the Imperial Sector and presumably she could wheedle \\nAndorin to her liking. He was desperate enough to ask a foolish question. “Mr. Andorin, \\nI keep wondering if maybe you brought Miss Dubanqua along with you. Here, to the \\nImperial Sector.”\\n\\nAndorin looked utterly astonished. Then he laughed gently. “Manella? Do you see her \\ndoing any gardening? Or even pretending she could? No no, Manella is one of those \\nwomen invented for our quiet moments. She has no function at all, otherwise.” Then \\n“Why do you ask, Planchet?”\\n\\nRaych shrugged. “I don’t know. It’s sort of dull around here. I sort of thought--” His \\nvoice trailed away.\\n\\nAndorin watched him carefully. Finally he said, “Surely you’re not of the opinion that it \\nmatters much which woman you are involved with? I assure you it doesn’t matter to her \\nwhich man she’s involved with. Once this is over, there will be other women. Plenty of \\n\\n',\n",
              " 'them.”\\n\\n“When will this be over?”\\n\\n“Soon. And you’re going to be part of it in a very important way.” Andorin watched \\nRaych narrowly.\\n\\nRaych said, “How important? Aren’t I gonna be just--a gardener?” His voice sounded \\nhollow and he found himself unable to put a spark in it.\\n\\n“You’ll be more than that, Planchet. You’ll be going in with a blaster.”\\n\\n“With a what?”\\n\\n“A blaster.”\\n\\n“I can’t kill anyone.”\\n\\n“I never held a blaster. Not in my whole life.”\\n\\n“There’s nothing to it. You lift it. You point it. You close the contact and someone dies.”\\n\\n“I thought you were one of us, that you would do anything for the cause.”\\n\\n“I didn’t mean--kill.” Raych couldn’t seem to collect his thoughts. Why must he kill? \\nWhat did they really have in mind for him? And how would he be able to alert the \\nImperial Guard before the killing would be carried out?\\n\\nAndorin’s face hardened suddenly, an instant conversion from friendly interest to stern \\ndecision. He said, “Youmust kill.”\\n\\nRaych gathered all his strength. “No. I ain’t gonna kill nobody. That’s final.”\\n\\nAndorin said, “Planchet, you will do as you are told.”\\n\\n“Not murder.”\\n\\n“Even murder.”\\n\\n“How you gonna make me?”\\n\\n“I shall simply tell you to.”\\n\\n',\n",
              " 'Raych felt dizzy. What made Andorin so confident?\\n\\nHe shook his head. “No.”\\n\\nAndorin said, “We’ve been feeding you, Planchet, ever since you left Wye. I made sure \\nyou ate with me. I supervised your diet. Especially the meal you just ate.”\\n\\nRaych felt the horror rise within him. He suddenly understood. “Desperance!”\\n\\n“Exactly,” said Andorin. “You’re a sharp devil, Planchet.”\\n\\n“It’s illegal.”\\n\\n“Yes, of course. So’s murder.”\\n\\nRaych knew about desperance. It was a chemical modification of a perfectly harmless \\ntranquilizer. The modified form, however, did not produce tranquillity but despair. It had \\nbeen outlawed because of its use in mind control, though there were persistent rumors \\nthat the Imperial Guard used it.\\n\\nAndorin said, as though it were not hard to read Raych’s mind, “It’s called desperance \\nbecause that’s an old word meaning ‘hopelessness.’ I think you’re feeling hopeless.”\\n\\n“Never,” whispered Raych.\\n\\n“No chance.”\\n\\n“Very resolute of you, but you can’t fight the chemical. And the more hopeless you feel, \\nthe more effective the drug.”\\n\\n“Think about it, Planchet. Namarti recognized you at once, even without your mustache. \\nHe knows you are Raych Seldon and, at my direction, you are going to kill your father.”\\n\\nRaych muttered, “Not before I kill you.”\\n\\nHe rose from his chair. There should be no problem at all in this. Andorin might be \\ntaller, but he was slender and clearly no athlete. Raych would break him in two with one \\narm--but he swayed as he rose. He shook his head, but it wouldn’t clear.\\n\\nAndorin rose, too, and backed away. He drew his right hand from where it had been \\nresting within his left sleeve. He was holding a weapon.\\n\\n',\n",
              " 'He said pleasantly, “I came prepared. I have been informed of your prowess as a \\nHeliconian Twister and there will be no hand-to-hand combat.”\\n\\nHe looked down at his weapon. “This is not a blaster,” he said. “I can’t afford to have \\nyou killed before you accomplish your task. It’s a neuronic whip. Much worse, in a way. \\nI will aim at your left shoulder and, believe me, the pain will be so excruciating that the \\nworld’s greatest stoic would not be able to endure it.”\\n\\nRaych, who had been advancing slowly and grimly, stopped abruptly. He had been \\ntwelve years old when he had had a taste--a small one--of a neuronic whip. Once struck, \\nno one ever forgets the pain, however long he lives, however full of incidents his life is.\\n\\nAndorin said, “Moreover, I will use full strength so that the nerves in your upper arms \\nwill be stimulated first into unbearable pain and then damaged into uselessness. You will \\nnever use your left arm again. I will spare the right so you can handle the blaster. --Now \\nif you sit down and accept matters, as you must, you may keep both arms. Of course, \\nyou must eat again so your desperance level increases. Your situation will only worsen.”\\n\\nRaych felt the drug-induced despair settle over him and that despair served, in itself, to \\ndeepen the effect. His vision was turning double and he could think of nothing to say.\\n\\nRaych only knew that he would have to do what Andorin would tell him to do. He had \\nplayed the game and he had lost.\\n\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\n 23\\n\\n      “No!” Hari Seldon was almost violent. “I don’t want you out there, Dors.”\\n\\nDors Venabili stared back at him with an expression as firm as his own. “Then I won’t \\nlet you go, either, Hari.”\\n\\n“I must be there.”\\n\\n“It isnot your place.

We must give them a chance to convict themselves of more \\nthan that. Besides--”\\n\\nThere was a long pause and Dors said wrathfully, “Well, what’s the new ‘besides’?”\\n\\nSeldon’s voice lowered. “One of the twelve is Raych, using the alias Planchet.”\\n\\n“What?”\\n\\n“Why are you surprised? I sent him to Wye to infiltrate the Joranumite movement and \\nhe’s succeeded in infiltrating something. I have every faith in him.

I want to be in a position to help him if I \\ncan.”\\n\\n“If you want to help him, have fifty guards of the Palace standing shoulder to shoulder \\non either side of your gardeners.”\\n\\n“No. Again, we’ll end up with nothing. The Imperial Guard will be in place but not in \\nevidence. The gardeners in question must think they have a clear hand to do whatever it \\nis they plan to do.

It wouldn’t be nice to ask in front of Grandfather.\\n\\nHer mother had no trouble whatever sensing Wanda’s consternation. She said, “One \\nminute, Hari, and let’s see what’s bothering Wanda. What is it, dear?”\\n\\nWanda pulled at her hand. “Not here, Mother. Private.”\\n\\nManella turned to Hari Seldon. “See how early it starts? Private lives. Private problems. \\nOf course, Wanda, shall we go to your room?”\\n\\n“Yes, Mother.” Wanda was clearly relieved.\\n\\nHand in hand, they went and then her mother said, “Now what is the problem, Wanda?”\\n\\n“It’s Grandfather, Mother.”\\n\\n“Grandfather! I can’t imagine him doing anything to bother you.”\\n\\n“Well, he is.” Wanda’s eyes filled with sudden tears. “Is he going to die?”\\n\\n“Your grandfather? What put that into your head, Wanda?”\\n\\n“He’s going to be sixty. That’s so old.”\\n\\n“No, it isn’t. It’s not young, but it’s not old, either. People live to be eighty, ninety, even \\na hundred--and your grandfather is strong and healthy. He’ll live a long time.”\\n\\n“Are you sure?” She was sniffing.\\n\\nManella grasped her daughter by the shoulders and looked her straight in the eyes. “We \\nmust all die someday, Wanda. I’ve explained that to you before. Just the same, we don’t \\nworry about it till the someday is much closer.” She wiped Wanda’s eyes gently. \\n“Grandfather is going to stay alive till you’re all grown up and have babies of your own. \\nYou’ll see. Now come back with me. I want you to talk to Grandfather.”\\n\\n',\n",
              " 'Wanda sniffed again.\\n\\nWanda shook her head.\\n\\nSeldon looked at the little girl with a sympathetic expression on her return and said, \\n“What is it, Wanda? Why are you unhappy?”\\n\\nSeldon turned his gaze to the girl’s mother. “Well, what is it, Manella?”\\n\\nManella shook her head. “She’ll have to tell you herself.”\\n\\nSeldon sat down and tapped his lap. “Come, Wanda. Have a seat and tell me your \\ntroubles.”\\n\\nShe obeyed and wriggled a bit, then said, “I’m scared.”\\n\\nSeldon put his arm around her. “Nothing to be scared of in your old grandfather.”\\n\\nManella made a face. “Wrong word.”\\n\\nSeldon looked up at her. “Grandfather?”\\n\\n“No. Old.”\\n\\nThat seemed to break the dike. Wanda burst into tears. “You’re old, Grandfather.”\\n\\n“I suppose so. I’m sixty.” He bent his face down to Wanda’s and whispered, “I don’t like \\nit, either, Wanda. That’s why I’m glad you’re only seven going on eight.”\\n\\n“Your hair is white, Grandpa.”\\n\\n“It wasn’t always. It just turned white recently.”\\n\\n“White hair means you’re going to die, Grandpa.”\\n\\nSeldon looked shocked. He said to Manella, “What is all this?”\\n\\n“I don’t know, Hari. It’s her own idea.”\\n\\n“I had a bad dream,” said Wanda.\\n\\n',\n",
              " 'Seldon cleared his throat. “We all have bad dreams now and then, Wanda. It’s good we \\ndo. Bad dreams get rid of bad thoughts and then we’re better off.”\\n\\n“It was about you dying, Grandfather.”\\n\\n“I know. I know. Dreams can be about dying, but that doesn’t make them important. \\nLook at me. Don’t you see how alive I am--and cheerful--and laughing? Do I look as \\nthough I’m dying? Tell me.”\\n\\n“There you are, then. Now you go out and play and forget all about this. I’m just having \\na birthday and everyone will have a good time. Go ahead, dear.”\\n\\nWanda left in reasonable cheer, but Seldon motioned to Manella to stay.\\n\\n      Seldon said, “Wherever do you think Wanda got such a notion?”\\n\\n“Come now, Hari. She had a Salvanian gecko that died, remember? One of her friends \\nhad a father who died in an accident and she sees deaths on holovision all the time. It is \\nimpossible for any child to be so protected as not to be aware of death. Actually I \\nwouldn’t want her to be so protected. Death is an essential part of life; she must learn \\nthat.”\\n\\n“I don’t mean death in general, Manella. I mean my death in particular. What has put \\nthat into her head?”\\n\\nManella hesitated. She was very fond, indeed, of Hari Seldon. She thought, Who would \\nnot be, so how can I say this?\\n\\nBut how could shenot say this? So she said, “Hari, you yourself put it into her head.”\\n\\n“Of course, you’ve been speaking for months of turning sixty and complaining loudly of \\ngrowing old. The only reason people are setting up this party is to console you.”\\n\\n“N-no.”\\n\\n  \\n\\n 2\\n\\n  \\n\\n“I?”\\n\\n',\n",
              " '“It’s no fun turning sixty,” said Seldon indignantly. “Wait! Wait! You’ll find out.”\\n\\n“I will--if I’m lucky. Some people don’t make it to sixty. Just the same, if turning sixty \\nand being old are all you talk about, you end up frightening an impressionable little \\ngirl.”\\n\\nSeldon sighed and looked troubled. “I’m sorry, but it’s hard. Look at my hands. They’re \\ngetting spotted and soon they’ll be gnarled. I can do hardly anything in the way of \\nTwisting any longer. A child could probably force me to my knees.”\\n\\n“In what way does that make you different from other sixty-year-olds? At least your \\nbrain is working as well as ever. How often have you said that that’s all that counts?”\\n\\n“I know. But I miss my body.”\\n\\nManella said with just a touch of malice, “Especially when Dors doesn’t seem to get any \\nolder.”\\n\\nSeldon said uneasily, “Well yes, I suppose--” He looked away, clearly unwilling to talk \\nabout the matter.\\n\\nManella looked at her father-in-law gravely. The trouble was, he knew nothing about \\nchildren--or about people generally. It was hard to think that he had spent ten years as \\nFirst Minister under the old Emperor and yet ended up knowing as little about people as \\nhe did.\\n\\nOf course, he was entirely wrapped up in this psychohistory of his, that dealt with \\nquadrillions of people, which ultimately meant dealing with no people at all--as \\nindividuals. And how could he know about children when he had had no contact with \\nany child except Raych, who had entered his life as a twelve-year-old? Now he had \\nWanda, who was--and would probably remain to him--an utter mystery.\\n\\nManella thought all this lovingly. She had the incredible desire to protect Hari Seldon \\nfrom a world he did not understand. It was the only point at which she and her mother-\\nin-law, Dors Venabili, met and coalesced--this desire to protect Hari Seldon.\\n\\nManella had saved Seldon’s life ten years before. Dors, in her strange way, had \\nconsidered this an invasion of her prerogative and had never quite forgiven Manella.\\n\\nSeldon, in his turn, had then saved Manella’s life. She closed her eyes briefly and the \\nwhole scene returned to her, almost as though it were happening to her right now.\\n\\n',\n",

All \\nof Trantor was in chaos.\\n\\nHari Seldon still kept his office as First Minister, but it was clear he had no power. He \\ncalled in Manella Dubanqua.\\n\\n“I want to thank you for saving Raych’s life and my own. I haven’t\\n\\nI a chance to do so yet.” Then with a sigh, “I have scarcely had a chance to do anything \\nthis past week.”\\n\\nManella asked, “What happened to the mad gardener?”\\n\\n“Executed! At once! No trial! I tried to save him by pointing out that was insane. But \\nthere was no question about it. If he had done anything else, committed any other crime, \\nhis madness would have been recognized and he would have been spared. Committed--\\nlocked up and treated--but spared, nonetheless. But to kill the Emperor--” Seldon shook \\nhis head sadly.\\n\\nManella said, “What’s going to happen now, First Minister?”\\n\\n“I’ll tell you what I think. The Entun Dynasty is finished. Cleon’s son will not succeed. I \\ndon’t think he wants to. He fears assassination in his turn and I don’t blame him one bit. \\nIt would be much better for him to retire to one of the family estates on some Outer \\nWorld and live a quiet Because he is a member of the Imperial House, he will untie \\nallowed to do this. You and I may be less fortunate.”\\n\\nManella frowned. “In what way, sir?”\\n\\nSeldon cleared his throat. “It is possible to argue that because you killed Gleb Andorin, \\nhe dropped his blaster, which became available to Mandell Gruber, who used it to kill \\nCleon. Therefore you bear a strong share of the responsibility of the crime and it may \\neven be said that it was all prearranged.”\\n\\n“But that’s ridiculous. I am a member of the security establishment, fulfilling my \\n\\n',\n",
              " 'duties--doing what I was ordered to do.”\\n\\nSeldon smiled sadly. “You’re arguing rationally and rationality is not going to be in \\nfashion for a while. What’s going to happen now, in the absence of a legitimate \\nsuccessor to the Imperial throne, is that we are bound to have a military government.”\\n\\n(In later years, when Manella came to understand the workings of psychohistory, she \\nwondered if Seldon had used the technique to work out what was going to happen, for \\nthe military rule certainly came to pass. At the time, however, he made no mention of his \\nfledgling theory.)\\n\\n“If we do have a military government,” he went on, “then it will be necessary for them \\nto establish a firm rule at once, crush any signs of disaffection, act vigorously and \\ncruelly, even in defiance of rationality and justice. If they accuse you, Miss Dubanqua, \\nof being part of a plot to kill the Emperor, you will be slaughtered, not as an act of \\njustice but as a way of cowing the people of Trantor.\\n\\n“For that matter, they might say that I was part of the plot, too. After all, I went out to \\ngreet the new gardeners when it was not my place to do so. Had I not done so, there \\nwould have been no attempt to kill me, you would not have struck back, and the \\nEmperor would have lived. --Do you see how it all fits?”\\n\\n“I can’t believe they will do this.”\\n\\n“Perhaps they won’t. I’ll make them an offer that, just perhaps, they may not wish to \\nrefuse.”\\n\\n“What would that be?”\\n\\n“I will offer to resign as First Minister. They don’t want me, they won’t have me. But the \\nfact is that I do have supporters at the Imperial Court and, even more important, people \\nin the Outer Worlds who find me acceptable. That means that if the members of the \\nImperial Guard force me out, then even if they don’t execute me, they will have some \\ntrouble. If, on the other hand, I resign, stating that I believe the military government is \\nwhat Trantor and the Empire needs, then I actually help them, you see?”\\n\\nHe mused a little and said, “Besides, there is the little matter of psychohistory.”\\n\\n(That was the first time Manella had ever heard the word.)\\n\\n“What’s that?”\\n\\n',\n",

I want my mustache back.”\\n\\nThe barber, who had already received his instructions from Seldon held up a mirror to \\nreassure him.\\n\\nDors Venabili, who was sitting at his bedside, said, “Let him work, Raych.

When the barber left, \\nDors said, “How do you feel, Raych?”\\n\\n“Rotten,” he muttered. “I’m so depressed, I can’t stand it.”\\n\\n“That’s the lingering effect of the desperance you’ve been dosed with. The effects will \\nwash out.”\\n\\n“I can’t believe it. How long has it been?”\\n\\n“Never mind. It will take time.

Do you intend to do nothing while he makes plans to marry a \\nwoman like that?”\\n\\n“What do you expect me to do, Dors? Manella saved Raych’s life. Do you expect him to \\nforget that? She saved mine, too, for that matter.”\\n\\nThat seemed to feed Dors’s anger. She said, “And you also saved her. The score is \\neven.”\\n\\n“I didn’t exactly--”\\n\\n“Of course you did. The military rascals who now run the Empire would have \\nslaughtered her if you didn’t step in and sell them your resignation and your support in \\norder to save her.”\\n\\n“Though I may have evened the score, which I don’t think I have, Raych has not. And, \\nDors dear, I would be very careful when it came to using unfortunate terms to describe \\nour government.

If it had not been for her quick action, both Raych and I would be dead.”\\n\\nDors snapped back, “Yes, Hari. I know that better than anyone. And if she had not been \\nthere, I would not have been able to do a thing to prevent your murder. I suppose you \\nthink I should be grateful.

So would I.”\\n\\n“Psychohistory has guided us pretty well in the last ten years.”\\n\\nThat was true enough, but Seldon knew that one couldn’t attach too much triumph to \\nthat. Things had gone smoothly and without major surprises.\\n\\nPsychohistory had predicted that the center would hold after Cleon’s death--predicted it \\nin a very dim and uncertain way--and it did hold. Trantor was reasonably quiet. Even \\nwith an assassination and the end of a dynasty, the center had held.\\n\\nIt did so under the stress of military rule--Dors was quite right in speaking of the junta as \\n“those military rascals.” She might have even gone farther in her accusations without \\nbeing wrong. Nevertheless, they were holding the Empire together and would continue \\nto do so for a time. Long enough, perhaps, to allow psychohistory to play an active role \\nin the events that were to transpire.\\n\\nLately Yugo had been speaking about the possible establishment of Foundations--\\nseparate, isolated, independent of the Empire itself serving as seeds for developments \\nthrough the forthcoming dark ages and into a new and better Empire. Seldon himself had \\nbeen working on the consequences of such an arrangement.\\n\\nBut he lacked the time and, he felt (with a certain misery), he lacked the youth as well. \\nHis mind, however firm and steady, did not have the resiliency and creativity that it had \\nhad when he was thirty and with each passing year, he knew he would have less.\\n\\n',\n",
              " 'Perhaps he ought to put the young and brilliant Elar on the task, taking him off \\neverything else. Seldon had to admit to himself, shamefacedly, that the possibility did \\nnot excite him. He did not want to have invented psychohistory so that some stripling \\ncould come in and reap the final fruits of fame. In fact, to put it at its most disgraceful, \\nSeldon felt jealous of Elar and realized it just sufficiently to feel ashamed of the \\nemotion.\\n\\nYet, regardless of his less rational feelings, he would have to depend on other younger \\nmen--whatever his discomfort over it. Psychohistory was no longer the private preserve \\nof himself and Amaryl. The decade of his being First Minister had converted it into a \\nlarge government-sanctioned and -budgeted undertaking and, quite to his surprise, after \\nresigning from his post as First Minister and returning to Streeling University, it had \\ngrown still larger. Hari grimaced at its ponderous--and pompous--official name: the \\nSeldon Psychohistory Project at Streeling University. But most people simply referred to \\nit as the Project.\\n\\nThe military junta apparently saw the Project as a possible political weapon and while \\nthat was so, funding was no problem. Credits poured in. In return, it was necessary to \\nprepare annual reports, which, however, were quite opaque. Only fringe matters were \\nreported on and even then the mathematics was not likely to be within the purview of \\nany of the members of the junta.\\n\\nIt was clear as he left his old assistant that Amaryl, at least, was more than satisfied with \\nthe way psychohistory was going and yet Seldon felt the blanket of depression settle \\nover him once more.\\n\\nHe decided it was the forthcoming birthday celebration that was bothering him. It was \\nmeant as a celebration of joy, but to Hari it was not even a gesture of consolation--it \\nmerely emphasized his age.\\n\\nBesides, it was upsetting his routine and Hari was a creature of habit. His office and a \\nnumber of those adjoining had been cleared out and it had been days since he had been \\nable to work normally. His proper offices would be converted into halls of glory, he \\nsupposed, and it would be many days before he could get back to work. Only Amaryl \\nabsolutely refused to budge and was able to maintain his office.\\n\\nSeldon had wondered, peevishly, who had thought of doing all this. It wasn’t Dors, of \\ncourse. She knew him entirely too well. Not Amaryl or Raych, who never even \\nremembered their own birthdays. He had suspected Manella and had even confronted \\nher on the matter.\\n\\nShe admitted that she was all for it and had given orders for the arrangements to take \\n\\n',\n",

If only the birthday were all over.\\n\\n  \\n\\n 7\\n\\n  \\n\\n      Dors poked her head through the door. “Am I allowed to come in?”\\n\\n“No, of course not. Why should you think I would?”\\n\\n“This is not your usual place.”\\n\\n“I know,” sighed Seldon. “I have been evicted from my usual place because of the stupid \\nbirthday party. How I wish it were over.”\\n\\n“There you are. Once that woman gets an idea in her head, it takes over and grows like \\nthe big bang.”\\n\\nSeldon changed sides at once. “Come. She means well, Dors.”\\n\\n“Save me from the well-meaning,” said Dors. “In any case, I’m here to discuss \\nsomething else. Something which may be important.”\\n\\n“Go ahead. What is it?”\\n\\n“I’ve been talking to Wanda about her dream--” She hesitated.\\n\\nSeldon made a gargling sound in the back of his throat, then said, can’t believe it. Just \\nlet it go.”\\n\\n“No. Did you bother to ask her for the details of the dream?”\\n\\n“Why should I put the little girl through that?”\\n\\n“Neither did Raych, nor Manella. It was left up to me.”\\n\\n',\n",
              " '“But why should you torture her with questions about it?”\\n\\n“Because I had the feeling I should,” said Dors grimly. “In the first place, she didn’t \\nhave the dream when she was home in her bed.”\\n\\n“Where was she, then?”\\n\\n“In your office.”\\n\\n“What was she doing in my office?”\\n\\n“She wanted to see the place where the party would be and she walked into your office \\nand, of course, there was nothing to see, as it’s been cleared out in preparation. But your \\nchair was still there. The large one--tall back, tall wings, broken-down--the one you \\nwon’t let me replace.”\\n\\nHari sighed, as if recalling a longstanding disagreement. “It’snot broken-down. I \\ndon’twant a new one. Go on.”\\n\\n“She curled up in your chair and began to brood over the fact that maybe you weren’t \\nreally going to have a party and she felt bad. Then, she tells me, she must have fallen \\nasleep because nothing is clear in her mind, except that in her dream there were two \\nmen--not women, she was sure about that--two men, talking.”\\n\\n“And what were they talking about?”\\n\\n“She doesn’t know exactly. You know how difficult it is to remember details under such \\ncircumstances. But she says it was about dying and she thought it was you because you \\nwere so old. And she remembers two words clearly. They were ‘lemonade death.’“\\n\\n“What?”\\n\\n“Lemonade death.”\\n\\n“What does that mean?”\\n\\n“I don’t know. In any case, the talking ceased, the men left, and there she was in the \\nchair, cold and frightened--and she’s been upset about it ever since.”\\n\\nSeldon mulled over Dors’s report. Then he said, “Look, dear, what importance can we \\nattach to a child’s dream?”\\n\\n',\n",
              " '“We can ask ourselves first, Hari, if it even was a dream.”\\n\\n“What do you mean?”\\n\\n“Wanda doesn’t say outright it was. She says she ‘must have fallen asleep.’ Those are \\nher words. She didn’t say she fell asleep, she said shemusthave fallen asleep.”\\n\\n“What do you deduce from that?”\\n\\n“She may have drifted off into a half-doze and, in that state, heard two men--two real \\nmen, not two dream men--talking.”\\n\\n“Real men? Talking about killing me with lemonade death?”\\n\\n“Something like that, yes.”\\n\\n“Dors,” said Seldon forcefully, “I know that you’re forever foreseeing danger for me, \\nbut this is going too far. Why should anyone want to kill me?”\\n\\n“It’s been tried twice before.”\\n\\n“So it has, but consider the circumstances. The first attempt came shortly after Cleon \\nappointed me First Minister. Naturally this was an offense to the well-established court \\nhierarchy and I was very resented. A few thought they might settle matters by getting rid \\nof me. The second time was when the Joranumites were trying to seize power and they \\nthought I was standing in their way--plus Namarti’s distorted dream of revenge.\\n\\n“Fortunately neither assassination attempt succeeded, but why should there now be a \\nthird? I am no longer First Minister and haven’t been for ten years. I am an aging \\nmathematician in retirement and surely no one has anything to fear from me. The \\nJoranumites have been rooted out and destroyed and Namarti was executed long ago. \\nThere is absolutely no motivation for anyone to want to kill me.\\n\\n“So please, Dors, relax. When you’re nervous about me, you get unsettled, which makes \\nyou more nervous still, and I don’t want that to happen.”\\n\\nDors rose from her seat and leaned across Hari’s desk. “It’s easy for you to say that there \\nis no motive to kill you, but none is needed. Our government is now a completely \\nirresponsible one and if they wish--”\\n\\n“Stop!” commanded Seldon loudly. Then, very quietly, “Not a word, Dors. Not a word \\n\\n',\n",
              " 'against the government. That could get us in the very trouble you’re foreseeing.”\\n\\n“I’m only talking to you, Hari.”\\n\\n“Right now you are, but if you get into the habit of saying foolish things, you don’t \\nknow when something will slip out in someone else’s presence--someone who will then \\nbe glad to report you. Just learn, as a matter of necessity, to refrain from political \\ncommentary.”\\n\\n“I’ll try, Hari,” said Dors, but she could not keep the indignation out of her voice. She \\nturned on her heel and left.\\n\\nSeldon watched her go. Dors had aged gracefully, so gracefully that at times she seemed \\nnot to have aged at all. Though she was two years younger than Seldon, her appearance \\nhad not changed nearly as much as his had in the twenty-eight years they had been \\ntogether. Naturally.\\n\\nHer hair was frosted with gray, but the youthful luster beneath the gray still shone \\nthrough. Her complexion had grown more sallow; her voice was a bit huskier, and, of \\ncourse, she wore clothes that were suitable for middle age. However, her movements \\nwere as agile and as quick as ever. It was as if nothing could be allowed to interfere with \\nher ability to protect Hari in case of an emergency.\\n\\nHari sighed. This business of being protected--more or less against his will, at all times--\\nwas sometimes a heavy burden.\\n\\n  \\n\\n 8\\n\\n  \\n\\n      Manella came to see Seldon almost immediately afterward.\\n\\n“Pardon me, Hari, but what has Dors been saying”\\n\\nSeldon looked up again. Nothing but interruptions.\\n\\n“It wasn’t anything important. Wanda’s dream.”\\n\\nManella’s lips pursed. “I knew it. Wanda said Dors was asking her questions about it. \\nWhy doesn’t she leave the girl alone? You would think that having a bad dream was \\n\\n',\n",
              " 'some sort of felony.”\\n\\n“As a matter of fact,” said Seldon soothingly, “it’s just a matter of something Wanda \\nremembered as part of the dream. I don’t know if Wanda told you, but apparently in her \\ndream she heard something about ‘lemonade death.’ “\\n\\n“Hmm!” Manella was silent for a moment. Then she said, “That doesn’t really matter so \\nmuch. Wanda is crazy about lemonade and she’s expecting lots of it at the party. I \\npromised she’d have some with Mycogenian drops in it and she’s looking forward to it.”\\n\\n“So that if she heard something that sounded anything like lemonade, it would be \\ntranslated into lemonade in her mind.”\\n\\n“Yes. Why not?”\\n\\n“Except that, in that case, what do you suppose it was that wasactually said? She must \\nhave heard something in order to misinterpret it.”\\n\\n“I don’t think that’s necessarily so. But why are we attaching so much importance to a \\nlittle girl’s dream? Please, I don’t want anyone talking to her about it anymore. It’s too \\nupsetting.”\\n\\n“I agree. I’ll see to it that Dors drops the subject--at least with Wanda.”\\n\\n“All right. I don’t care if she is Wanda’s grandmother, Hari. I’m her mother, after all, and \\nmy wishes come first.”\\n\\n“Absolutely,” said Seldon soothingly and looked after Manella as she left. That was \\nanother burden--the unending competition between those two women.\\n\\n  \\n\\n 9\\n\\n  \\n\\n      Tamwile Elar was thirty-six years old and had joined Seldon’s Psychohistory Project \\nas Senior Mathematician four years earlier. He was a tall man, with a habitual twinkle in \\nhis eye and with more than a touch of self-assurance as well.\\n\\nHis hair was brown and had a loose wave in it, the more noticeable because he wore it \\nrather long. He had an abrupt way of laughing, but there was no fault to be found with \\n\\n',\n",
              " 'his mathematical ability.\\n\\nElar had been recruited from the West Mandanov University and Seldon always had to \\nsmile when he remembered how suspicious Yugo Amaryl had been of him at first. But \\nthen, Amaryl was suspicious of everyone. Deep in his heart (Seldon felt sure), Amaryl \\nfelt that psychohistory ought to have remained his and Hari’s private province.\\n\\nBut even Amaryl was now willing to admit that Elar’s membership in the group had \\neased his own situation tremendously. Yugo said, “His techniques for avoiding chaos are \\nunique and fascinating. No one else in the Project could have worked it out the way he \\ndid. Certainly nothing of this sort ever occurred to me. It didn’t occur to you, either, \\nHari.”\\n\\n“Well,” said Seldon grumpily, “I’m getting old.”\\n\\n“If only,” said Amaryl, “he didn’t laugh so loud.”\\n\\n“People can’t help the way they laugh.”\\n\\nYet the truth was that Seldon found himself having a little trouble accepting Elar. It was \\nrather humiliating that he himself had come nowhere near the “achaotic equations,” as \\nthey were now called. It didn’t bother Seldon that he had never thought of the principle \\nbehind the Electro-Clarifier--that was not really his field. The achaotic equations, \\nhowever, he should, indeed, have thought of--or at least gotten close to.\\n\\nHe tried reasoning with himself. Seldon had worked out the entire basis for \\npsychohistory and the achaotic equations grew naturally out of that basis. Could Elar \\nhave done Seldon’s work three decades earlier? Seldon was convinced that Elar couldn’t \\nhave. And was it so remarkable that Elar had thought up the principle of achaotism once \\nthe basis was in place?\\n\\nAll this was very sensible and very true, yet Seldon still found himself uneasy when \\nfacing Elar. Just slightly edgy. Weary age facing flamboyant youth.\\n\\nYet Elar never gave him obvious cause for feeling the difference in years. He never \\nfailed to show Seldon full respect or in any way to imply that the older man had passed \\nhis prime.\\n\\nOf course, Elar was interested in the forthcoming festivities and had even, as Seldon had \\ndiscovered, been the first to suggest that Seldon’s birthday be celebrated. (Was this a \\nnasty emphasis on Seldon’s age? Seldon dismissed the possibility. If he believedthat , it \\nwould mean he was picking up some of Dors’s tricks of suspicion.\\n\\n',\n",
              " 'Elar strode toward him and said, “Maestro--” And Seldon winced, as always. He much \\npreferred to have the senior members of the Project call him Hari, but it seemed such a \\nsmall point to make a fuss over.\\n\\n“Maestro,” said Elar. “The word is out that you’ve been called in for a conference with \\nGeneral Tennar.”\\n\\n“Yes. He’s the new head of the military junta and I suppose he wants to see me to ask \\nwhat psychohistory is all about. They’ve been asking me that since the days of Cleon \\nand Demerzel.” (The new head! The junta was like a kaleidoscope, with some of its \\nmembers periodically falling from grace and others rising from nowhere.)\\n\\n“But it’s my understanding he wants it now--right in the middle of the birthday \\ncelebration.”\\n\\n“That doesn’t matter. You can all celebrate without me.”\\n\\n“No, we can’t, Maestro. I hope you don’t mind, but some of us got together and put in a \\ncall to the Palace and put the appointment off for a week.”\\n\\n“What?” said Seldon annoyed. “Surely that was presumptuous of you--and risky, \\nbesides.”\\n\\n“It worked out well. They’ve put it off and you’ll need that time.”\\n\\n“Why would I need a week?”\\n\\nElar hesitated. “May I speak frankly, Maestro?”\\n\\n“Of course you can. When have I ever asked that anyone speak to me m any way but \\nfrankly?”\\n\\nElar flushed slightly, his fair skin reddening, but his voice remained steady. “It’s not \\neasy to say this, Maestro. You’re a genius at mathematics. No one on the Project has any \\ndoubt of that. No one in the Empire--they knew you and understood mathematics--\\nwould have any doubt Tout it. However, it is not given to anybody to be a universal \\ngenius.”\\n\\n“I know that as well as you do, Elar.”\\n\\n“I know you do. Specifically, though, you lack the ability to handle ordinary people--\\n\\n',\n",
              " 'shall we say, stupid people. You lack a certain deviousness, a certain ability to sidestep, \\nand if you are dealing with someone who is both powerful in government and somewhat \\nstupid, you can easily endanger the Project and, for that matter, your own life, simply \\nbecause you are too frank.”\\n\\n“What is this? Am I suddenly a child? I’ve been dealing with politicians for a long time. \\nI was First Minister for ten years, as perhaps you may remember.”\\n\\n“Forgive me, Maestro, but you were not an extraordinarily effective one. You dealt with \\nFirst Minister Demerzel, who was very intelligent, by all accounts, and with the \\nEmperor Cleon, who was very friendly. Now you will encounter military people who are \\nneither intelligent nor friendly--another matter entirely.”\\n\\n“I’ve even dealt with military people and survived.”\\n\\n“Not with General Dugal Tennar. He’s another sort of thing altogether. I know him.”\\n\\n“You know him? You have met him?”\\n\\n“I don’t know him personally, but he’s from Mandanov, which, as you know, is my \\nsector, and he was a power there before he joined the junta and rose through its ranks.”\\n\\n“And what do you know about him?”\\n\\n“Ignorant, superstitious, violent. He is not someone you can handle easily--or safely. \\nYou can use the week to work out methods for dealing with him.”\\n\\nSeldon bit his lower lip. There was something to what Elar said and Seldon recognized \\nthe fact that, while he had plans of his own, it would still be difficult to try to manipulate \\na stupid, self-important, short-tempered person with overwhelming force at his disposal.\\n\\nHe said uneasily, “I’ll manage somehow. The whole matter of a military junta is, in any \\ncase, an unstable situation in the Trantor of today. It has already lasted longer than might \\nhave seemed likely.”\\n\\n“Have we been testing that? I was not aware that we were making stability decisions on \\nthe junta.”\\n\\n“Just a few calculations by Amaryl, making use of your achaotic equations.” He paused. \\n“By the way, I’ve come across some references to them as the Elar Equations.”\\n\\n“Not by me, Maestro.”\\n\\n',\n",
              " '“I hope you don’t mind, but I don’t want that. Psychohistoric elements are to be \\ndescribed functionally and not personally. As soon as personalities intervene, bad \\nfeelings arise.”\\n\\n  \\n\\n “I understand and quite agree, Maestro.”\\n\\n“In fact,” said Seldon with a touch of guilt, “I have always felt it wrong that we speak of \\nthe basic Seldon Equations of Psychohistory. The trouble is that’s been in use for so \\nmany years, it’s not practical to try to change it.”\\n\\n“If you’ll excuse my saying so, Maestro, you’re an exceptional case. No one, I think, \\nwould quarrel with your receiving full credit for inventing the science of psychohistory. \\n--but, if I may, I wish to get back to your meeting with General Tennar.”\\n\\n“Well, what else is there to say?”\\n\\n“I can’t help but wonder if it might be better if you did not see him, did not speak to \\nhim, did not deal with him.”\\n\\n“How am I to avoid that if he calls me in for a conference?”\\n\\n“Perhaps you can plead illness and send someone in your place.”\\n\\n“Whom?”\\n\\nElar was silent for a moment, but his silence was eloquent.\\n\\nSeldon said, “You, I take it.”\\n\\n“Might that not be the thing to do? I am a fellow sectoral citizen of the General, which \\nmay carry some weight. You are a busy man, getting 011 in years, and it would be easy \\nto believe that you are not entirely well. And if I see him, rather than yourself-please \\nexcuse me, Maestro--I can wiggle and maneuver more easily than you can.”\\n\\n“Lie, you mean.”\\n\\n“If necessary.”\\n\\n“You’ll be taking a huge chance.”\\n\\n',\n",
              " '“Not too huge. I doubt that he will order my execution. If he becomes annoyed with me, \\nas he well might, then I can plead--or you can plead on my behalf--youth and \\ninexperience. In any case, if I get into trouble, that will be far less dangerous than if you \\nwere to do so. I’m thinking of the Project, which can do without me a great deal more \\neasily than it can without you.”\\n\\nSeldon said with a frown, “I’m not going to hide behind you, Elar. If the man wants to \\nsee me, he will see me. I refuse to shiver and shake and ask you to take chances for me. \\nWhat do you think I am?”\\n\\n“A frank and honest man--when the need is for a devious one.”\\n\\n“I will manage to be devious--if I must. Please don’t underestimate me, Elar.”\\n\\nElar shrugged hopelessly. “Very well. I can only argue with you up to a certain point.”\\n\\n“In fact, Elar, I wish you had not postponed the meeting. I would rather skip my birthday \\nand see the General than the reverse. This birthday celebration was not my idea.” His \\nvoice died away in a grumble.\\n\\nElar said, “I’m sorry.”\\n\\n“Well,” said Seldon with resignation, “we’ll see what happens.”\\n\\nHe turned and left. Sometimes he wished ardently that he could run what was called a \\n“tight ship,” making sure that everything went as he wished it to, leaving little or no \\nroom for maneuvering among his subordinates. To do that, however, would take \\nenormous time, enormous effort, would deprive him of any chance of working on \\npsychohistory himself--and, besides, he simply lacked the temperament for it.\\n\\nHe sighed.

Looking \\nup finally, he said, “What was his excuse?”\\n\\n“It wasn’t he. Some of our mathematicians arranged a week’s postponement so that it \\nwouldn’t interfere with the birthday celebration. I find all of this to be extremely \\nannoying.”\\n\\n“Why did you let them do that?”\\n\\n“I didn’t. They just went ahead and arranged things.” Seldon shrugged. “In a way, it’s \\nmy fault. I’ve whined so long about turning sixty that everyone thinks they have to cheer \\nme up with festivities.”\\n\\nAmaryl said, “Of course, we can use the week.”\\n\\nSeldon sat forward, immediately tense. “Is something wrong?”\\n\\n“No. Not that I can see, but it won’t hurt to examine it further. Look, Hari, this is the \\nfirst time in nearly thirty years that psychohistory has leached the point where it can \\nactually make a prediction. It’s not much of one--it’s just a small pinch of the vast \\ncontinent of humanity--but it’s t lie best we’ve had so far. All right. We want to take \\nadvantage of that, see how it works, prove to ourselves that psychohistory is what we \\nthink it is: a predictive science. So it won’t hurt to make sure that we haven’t overlooked \\nanything. Even this tiny bit of prediction is complex and I welcome another week of \\nstudy.”\\n\\n“Very well, then. I’ll consult you on the matter before I go to see the General for any \\nlast-minute modifications that have to be made. Meanwhile, Yugo, do not allow any \\ninformation concerning this to leak out to the others--not toanyone . If it fails, I don’t \\nwant the people of the Project to grow downhearted. You and I will absorb the failure \\nourselves and keep on trying.”\\n\\nA rare wistful smile crossed Amaryl’s face. “You and I. Do you remember when it really \\nwas just the two of us?”\\n\\n“I remember it very well and don’t think that I don’t miss those days.

There was Dors Venabili smiling, looking somewhat \\nyounger--Raych as a teenager, still unpolished--Seldon and Amaryl, looking \\nunbelievably young, bent over their computers. There was even a fleeting sight of Eto \\nDemerzel, which filled Seldon’s heart with yearning for his old friend and the security \\nhe had felt before Demerzel’s departure.\\n\\nThe Emperor Cleon appeared nowhere in the holographics. It was not because \\nholographs of him did not exist, but it was not wise, under the rule of the junta, to \\nremind people of the past Imperium.\\n\\nIt all poured outward, overflowing, filling room after room, building after building. \\nSomehow, time had been found to convert the entire University into a display the likes \\nof which Seldon had never seen or even imagined. Even the dome lights were darkened \\nto produce an artificial night against which the University would sparkle for three days.\\n\\n“Three days!” said Seldon, half-impressed, half-horrified.\\n\\n“Three days,” said Dors Venabili, nodding her head. “The University would consider \\nnothing less.”\\n\\n“The expense! The labor!” said Seldon, frowning.\\n\\n“The expense is minimal,” said Dors, “compared to what you have done for the \\nUniversity. And the labor is all voluntary.

I had no idea that they would do anything like this.”\\n\\n“Why not? You’re an icon, Hari. The whole world--the whole Empire--knows about \\nyou.”\\n\\n“They do not,” said Seldon, shaking his head vigorously. “Not one in a billion knows \\nanything at all about me--and certainly not about psychohistory.

But three days and three nights! The place will be reduced to splinters.”\\n\\n“No, it won’t. All the records have been stored away. The computers and other \\nequipment have been secured. The students have set up a virtual security force that will \\nprevent anything from being damaged.”\\n\\n“You’ve seen to all of that, haven’t you, Dors?” said Seldon, smiling at her fondly.\\n\\n“A number of us have. It’s by no means all me. Your colleague Tamwile Elar has worked \\nwith incredible dedication.”\\n\\nSeldon scowled.\\n\\n“What’s the matter with Elar?” said Dors.\\n\\nSeldon said, “He keeps calling me ‘Maestro.’ “\\n\\nDors shook her head. “Well, there’s a terrible crime.”\\n\\nSeldon ignored that and said, “And he’s young.”\\n\\n“Worse and worse. Come, Hari, you’re going to have to learn to grow old gracefully--\\n\\n',\n",
              " 'and to begin with you’ll have to show that you’re enjoying yourself. That will please \\nothers and increase their enjoyment and surely you would want to do that. Come on. \\nMove around. Don’t hide here with me. Greet everyone. Smile. Ask after their health. \\nAnd remember that, after the banquet, you’re going to have to make a speech.”\\n\\n“I dislike banquets and I doubly dislike speeches.”\\n\\n“You’ll have to, anyway. Now move!”\\n\\nSeldon sighed dramatically and did as he was told. He cut quite an imposing figure as he \\nstood in the archway leading into the main hall. The voluminous First Minister’s robes \\nof yesteryear were gone, as were the Heliconian-style garments he had favored in his \\nyouth. Now Seldon wore an outfit that bespoke his elevated status: straight pants, crisply \\npleated, a modified tunic on top. Embroidered in silver thread above his heart was the \\ninsignia: SELDON PSYCHOHISTORY PROJECT AT STREELING UNIVERSITY. It \\nsparkled like a beacon against the dignified titanium-gray hue of his clothing. Seldon’s \\neyes twinkled in a face now lined by age, his sixty years given away as much by his \\nwrinkles as by his white hair.\\n\\nHe entered the room in which the children were feasting. The room had been entirely \\ncleared, except for trestles with food upon them. The children rushed up to him as soon \\nas they saw him--knowing, as they did, that he was the reason for the feast--and Seldon \\ntried to avoid their clutching fingers.\\n\\n“Wait, wait, children,” he said. “Now stand back.”\\n\\nHe pulled a small computerized robot from his pocket and placed it on the floor. In an \\nEmpire without robots, this was something that he could expect to be eye-popping. It \\nhad the shape of a small furry animal, but it also had the capacity to change shapes \\nwithout warning (eliciting squeals of children’s laughter each time) and when it did so, \\nthe sounds and motions it made changed as well.\\n\\n“Watch it,” said Seldon, “and play with it, and try not to break it. Later on, there’ll be \\none for each of you.”\\n\\nHe slipped out into the hallway leading back to the main hall and realized, as he did so, \\nthat Wanda was following him.\\n\\n“Grandpa,” she said.\\n\\nWell, of course, Wanda was different. He swooped down and lifted her high in the air, \\nturned her over, and put her down.\\n\\n',\n",
              " '“Are you having a good time, Wanda?” he asked.\\n\\n“Yes,” she said, “but don’t go into that room.”\\n\\n“Why not, Wanda? It’s my room. It’s the office where I work.”\\n\\n“It’s where I had my bad dream.”\\n\\n“I know, Wanda, but that’s all over, isn’t it?” He hesitated, then he led Wanda to one of \\nthe chairs lining the hallway. He sat down and placed her on his lap.\\n\\n“Wanda,” he said, “are you sure it was a dream?”\\n\\n“I think it was a dream.”\\n\\n“Were you really sleeping?”\\n\\n“I think I was.”\\n\\nShe seemed uncomfortable talking about it and Seldon decided to let it go. There was no \\nuse pushing her any further.\\n\\nHe said, “Well, dream or not, there were two men and they talked of lemonade death, \\ndidn’t they?”\\n\\nWanda nodded reluctantly.\\n\\nSeldon said, “You’re sure they said lemonade?”\\n\\nWanda nodded again.\\n\\n“Might they have said something else and you thought they said lemonade?”\\n\\n“Lemonade is what they said.”\\n\\nSeldon had to be satisfied with that. “Well, run off and have a good time, Wanda. Forget \\nabout the dream.”\\n\\n“All right, Grandpa.” She cheered up as soon as the matter of the dream was dismissed \\nand off she went to join the festivities.\\n\\n',\n",
              " 'Seldon went to search for Manella. It took him an extraordinarily long time to find her, \\nsince, at every step, he was stopped, greeted, and conversed with.\\n\\nFinally he saw her in the distance. Muttering, “Pardon me-- Pardon me-- There’s \\nsomeone I must-- Pardon me--,” he worked his way over to her with considerable \\ntrouble.\\n\\n“Manella,” he said and drew her off to one side, smiling mechanically in all directions.\\n\\n“Yes, Hari,” she said. “Is something wrong?”\\n\\n“It’s Wanda’s dream.”\\n\\n“Don’t tell me she’s still talking about it.”\\n\\n“Well, it’s still bothering her. Listen, we have lemonade at the party, haven’t we?”\\n\\n“Of course, the children adore it. I’ve added a couple of dozen different Mycogenian \\ntaste buds to very small glasses of different shapes and the children try them one after \\nthe other to see which taste best. The adults have been drinking it, too. I have. Why \\ndon’t you taste it, Hari? It’s great.”\\n\\n“I’m thinking. If it wasn’t a dream, if the child really heard two men speak of lemonade \\ndeath--” He paused, as though ashamed to continue.\\n\\nManella said, “Are you thinking that someone poisoned the lemonade? That’s \\nridiculous. By now every child in the place would be sick or dying.”\\n\\n“I know,” muttered Seldon. “I know.”\\n\\nHe wandered off and almost didn’t see Dors when he passed her. She seized his elbow.\\n\\n“Why the face?” she said. “You look concerned.”\\n\\n“I’ve been thinking of Wanda’s lemonade death.”\\n\\n“So have I, but I can’t make anything of it so far.”\\n\\n“I can’t help but think of the possibility of poisoning.”\\n\\n“Don’t. I assure you that every bit of food that came into this party has been molecularly \\nchecked. I know you’ll think that’s my typical paranoia, but my task is guarding you and \\n\\n',\n",

I didn’t really think--”\\n\\n“Let’s hope not,” said Dors dryly. “What concerns me far more than this myth of poison \\nis that I have heard that you’re going to be seeing that monster Tennar in a few days.”\\n\\n“Don’t call him a monster, Dors. Be careful. We’re surrounded by cars and tongues.”\\n\\nDors immediately lowered her voice. “I suppose you’re right. Look ;round. All these \\nsmiling faces--and yet who knows which of our friends’ will be reporting back to the \\nhead and his henchmen when the night is over? Ah, humans! Even after all these \\nthousands of centuries, to think that such base treachery still exists. It seems to me to be \\nso unnecessary. Yet I know the harm it can do. That is why I must go with you, Hari.”\\n\\n“Impossible, Dors. It would just complicate matters for me. I’ll go Myself and I’ll have \\nno trouble.”\\n\\n“You would have no idea how to handle the General.”\\n\\nSeldon looked grave. “Andyou would? You sound exactly like Elar. He, too, is \\nconvinced that I am a helpless old fool. He, too, wants to come with me--or, rather, to go \\nin my place. --I wonder how many people on Trantor are willing to take my place,” he \\nadded with clear sarcasm. “Dozens? Millions?”\\n\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\n 12\\n\\n      For ten years the Galactic Empire had been without an Emperor, but there was no \\nindication of that fact in the way the Imperial Palace grounds were operated. Millennia \\nof custom made the absence of an Emperor meaningless.\\n\\nIt meant, of course, that there was no figure in Imperial robes to preside over formalities \\nof one sort or another. No Imperial voice gave orders; no Imperial wishes made \\nthemselves known; no Imperial gratifications or annoyances made themselves felt; no \\n\\n',\n",
              " 'Imperial pleasures warmed either Palace; no Imperial sicknesses cast them in gloom. \\nThe Emperor’s own quarters in the Small Palace were empty--the Imperial family did \\nnot exist.\\n\\nAnd yet the army of gardeners kept the grounds in perfect condition. An army of service \\npeople kept the buildings in top shape. The Emperor’s bed--never slept in--was made \\nwith fresh sheets every day; the rooms were cleaned; everything worked as it always \\nworked; and the entire Imperial staff, from top to bottom, worked as they had always \\nworked. The top officials gave commands as they would have done if the Emperor had \\nlived, commands that they knew the Emperor would have given. In many cases, in \\nparticular in the higher echelons, the personnel were the same as those who had been \\nthere on Cleon’s last day of life. The new personnel who had been taken on were \\ncarefully molded and trained into the traditions they would have to serve.\\n\\nIt was as though the Empire, accustomed to the rule of an Emperor, insisted on this \\n“ghost rule” to hold the Empire together.\\n\\nThe junta knew this--or, if they didn’t, they felt it vaguely. In ten years none of those \\nmilitary men who had commanded the Empire had moved into the Emperor’s private \\nquarters in the Small Palace. Whatever these men were, they were not Imperial and they \\nknew they had no rights there. A populace that endured the loss of liberty would not \\nendure any sign of irreverence to the Emperor--alive or dead.\\n\\nEven General Tennar had not moved into the graceful structure that had housed the \\nEmperors of a dozen different dynasties for so long. He Hid made his home and office in \\none of the structures built on the outskirts of the grounds--eyesores, but eyesores that \\nwere built like fortresses, sturdy enough to withstand a siege, with outlying buildings in \\nwhich an enormous force of guards was housed.\\n\\nTennar was a stocky man, with a mustache. It was not a vigorous overflowing Dahlite \\nmustache but one that was carefully clipped and fitted to the upper lip, leaving a strip of \\nskin between the hair and the line of the lip. It was a reddish mustache and Tennar had \\ncold blue eyes. He had probably been a handsome man in his younger days, but his face \\nwas pudgy now and his eyes were slits that expressed anger more often than any other \\nemotion.\\n\\nSo he said angrily--as one would, who felt himself to be absolute master of millions of \\nworlds and yet who dared not call himself an Emperor--to Hender Linn, “I can establish \\na dynasty of my own.” He hooked around with a scowl. “This is not a fitting place for \\nthe master of the Empire.”\\n\\nLinn said softly, “To be master is what is important. Better to be a master in a cubicle \\n\\n',\n",
              " 'than a figurehead in a palace.”\\n\\n“Best yet, to be master in a palace. Why not?”\\n\\nLinn bore the title of colonel, but it is quite certain that he had never engaged in any \\nmilitary action. His function was that of telling Tennar what he wanted to hear--and of \\ncarrying his orders, unchanged, to others. On occasion--if it seemed safe--he might try to \\nsteer Tennar into more prudent courses.\\n\\nLinn was well known as “Tennar’s lackey” and knew that was how he was known. It did \\nnot bother him. As lackey, he was safe--and he had seen the downfall of those who had \\nbeen too proud to be lackeys.\\n\\nThe time might, of course, come when Tennar himself would be buried in the ever-\\nchanging junta panorama, but Linn felt, with a certain amount of philosophy, that he \\nwould be aware of it in time and save himself. --or he might not. There was a price for \\neverything.\\n\\n“No reason why you can’t found a dynasty, General,” said Linn. Many others have done \\nit in the long Imperial history. Still, it takes lime. The people are slow to adapt. It is \\nusually only the second or even third of the dynasty who is fully accepted as Emperor.”\\n\\n“I don’t believe that. I need merely announce myself as new Emperor. Who will dare \\nquarrel with that? My grip is tight.”\\n\\n“So it is, General. Your power is unquestioned on Trantor and in most of the Inner \\nWorlds, yet it is possible that many in the farther Outer Worlds will not just yet--accept a \\nnew Imperial dynasty.”\\n\\n“Inner Worlds or Outer Worlds, military force rules all. That is an old Imperial maxim.”\\n\\n“And a good one,” said Linn, “but many of the provinces have armed forces of their \\nown, nowadays, that they may not use on your behalf. These are difficult times.”\\n\\n“You counsel caution, then.”\\n\\n“I always counsel caution, General.”\\n\\n“And someday you may counsel it once too often.”\\n\\nLinn bent his head. “I can only counsel what seems to me to be good and useful to you, \\nGeneral.”\\n\\n',\n",
              " '“As in your constant harping to me about this Hari Seldon.”\\n\\n“He is your greatest danger, General.”\\n\\n“So you keep saying, but I don’t see it. He’s just a college professor.”\\n\\nLinn said, “So he is, but he was once First Minister.”\\n\\n“I know, but that was in Cleon’s time. Has he done anything since? With times being \\ndifficult and with the governors of the provinces being fractious, why is a professor my \\ngreatest danger?”\\n\\n“It is sometimes a mistake,” said Linn carefully (for one had to be careful in educating \\nthe General), “to suppose that a quiet unobtrusive man can be harmless. Seldon has been \\nanything but harmless to those he has opposed. Twenty years ago the Joranumite \\nmovement almost destroyed Cleon’s powerful First Minister, Eto Demerzel.”\\n\\nTennar nodded, but the slight frown on his face betrayed his effort to remember the \\nmatter.\\n\\n“It was Seldon who destroyed Joranum and who succeeded Demerzel as First Minister. \\nThe Joranumite movement survived, however, and Seldon engineered its destruction, \\ntoo, but not before it succeeded in bringing about the assassination of Cleon.”\\n\\n“But Seldon survived that, didn’t he?”\\n\\n“You are perfectly correct. Seldon survived.”\\n\\n“That is strange. To have permitted an Imperial assassination should have meant death \\nfor a First Minister.”\\n\\n“So it should have. Nevertheless, the junta has allowed him to live. It seemed wiser to \\ndo so.”\\n\\n“Why?”\\n\\nLinn sighed internally. “There is something called psychohistory, General.”\\n\\n“I know nothing about that,” said Tennar flatly.\\n\\nActually he had a vague memory of Linn trying to talk to him on a number of occasions \\n\\n',\n",
              " 'concerning this strange collection of syllables. He had never wanted to listen and Linn \\nhad known better than to push the matter. Tennar didn’t want to listen now, either, but \\nthere seemed to be a hidden urgency in Linn’s words. Perhaps, Tennar thought, he had \\nnow better listen.\\n\\n“Almost no one knows anything about it,” said Linn, “yet there are a few--uh--\\nintellectuals, who find it of interest.”\\n\\n“And what is it?”\\n\\n“It is a complex system of mathematics.”\\n\\nTennar shook his head. “Leave me out of that, please. I can count my military divisions. \\nThat’s all the mathematics I need.”\\n\\n“The story is,” said Linn, “that psychohistory may make it possible to predict the \\nfuture.”\\n\\nThe General’s eyes bulged. “You mean this Seldon is a fortune--\\n\\n“Not in the usual fashion. It is a matter of science.”\\n\\n“I don’t believe it.”\\n\\n“It is hard to believe, but Seldon has become something of a cult figure here on Trantor--\\nand in certain places in the Outer Worlds. Now psychohistory--if it can be used to \\npredict the future or if even people merely think it can be so used--can be a powerful \\ntool with which to uphold the regime. I’m sure you have already seen this, General. One \\nneed merely predict our regime will endure and bring forth peace and prosperity for the \\nEmpire. People, believing this, will help make it a self-fulfilling prophecy. On the other \\nhand, if Seldon wishes the reverse, he can predict civil war and ruin. People will believe \\nthat, too, and that would destabilize the regime.”\\n\\n“In that case, Colonel, we simply make sure that the predictions of psychohistory are \\nwhat we want them to be.”\\n\\n“It would be Seldon who would have to make them and he is not a friend of the regime. \\nIt is important, General, that we differentiate between the Project that is working at \\nStreeling University to perfect psychohistory and Hari Seldon. Psychohistory can be \\nextremely useful to us, but it will be so only if someone other than Seldon were in \\ncharge.”\\n\\n',\n",
              " '“Are there others who could be?”\\n\\n“Oh yes. It is only necessary to get rid of Seldon.”\\n\\n“What is so difficult with that? An order of execution--and it is done.”\\n\\n“It would be better, General, if the government was not seen to be directly involved in \\nsuch a thing.”\\n\\n“I have arranged to have him meet with you, so that you can use your skill to probe his \\npersonality. You would then be able to judge whether certain suggestions I have in mind \\nare worthwhile or not.”\\n\\n“When is the meeting to take place?”\\n\\n“It was to take place very soon, but his representatives at the Project asked for a few \\ndays leeway, because they were in the process of celebrating his birthday--his sixtieth, \\napparently. It seemed wise to allow that and to permit a week’s delay.”\\n\\n“Why?” demanded Tennar. “I dislike any display of weakness.”\\n\\n“Quite right, General. Quite right. Your instincts are, as always, correct. However, it \\nseemed to me that the needs of the state might require us to know what and how the \\nbirthday celebration--which is taking place right now--might involve.”\\n\\n“Why?”\\n\\n“All knowledge is useful. Would you care to see some of the festivities?”\\n\\nGeneral Tennar’s face remained dark. “Is that necessary?”\\n\\n“I think you will find it interesting, General.”\\n\\nThe reproduction--sight and sound--was excellent and for quite a while the hilarity of \\nthe birthday celebration filled the rather stark room in which the General sat.\\n\\nLinn’s low voice served as commentary. “Most of this, General, is taking place in the \\nProject complex, but the rest of the University is involved. We will have an air view in a \\nfew moments and you will see that the celebration covers a wide area. In fact, though I \\ndon’t have the evidence available right now, there are corners of the planet here and \\nthere, in various University and sectoral settings mostly, where what we might call \\n‘sympathy celebrations’ of one sort or another are taking place. The celebrations are still \\n\\n',\n",
              " 'continuing and will endure for another day at least.”\\n\\n“Are you telling me that this is a Trantor-wide celebration?”\\n\\n“In a specialized way. It affects mostly the intellectual classes, but it is surprisingly \\nwidespread. It may even be that there is some shouting on worlds other than Trantor.”\\n\\n“Where did you get this reproduction?”\\n\\nLinn smiled. “Our facilities in the Project are quite good. We have reliable sources of \\ninformation, so that little can happen that doesn’t come our way at once.”\\n\\n“Well then, Linn, what are all your conclusions about this?”\\n\\n“It seems to me, General, and I’m sure that it seems so to you, that Hari Seldon is the \\nfocus of a personality cult. He has so identified himself with psychohistory that if we \\nwere to get rid of him in too open a manner, we would entirely destroy the credibility of \\nthe science. It would be useless to us.\\n\\n“On the other hand, General, Seldon is growing old and it is not difficult to imagine him \\nbeing replaced by another man: someone we could choose and who would be friendly to \\nour great aims and hopes for the Empire. If Seldon could be removed in such a way that \\nit is made to seem natural, then that is all we need.”\\n\\nThe General said, “And you think I ought to see him?”\\n\\n“Yes, in order to weigh his quality and decide what we ought to do. But we must be \\ncautious, for he is a popular man.”\\n\\n“I have dealt with popular people before,” said Tennar darkly.\\n\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\n 13\\n\\n      “Yes,” said Hari Seldon wearily, “it was a great triumph. I had a wonderful time. I \\ncan hardly wait until I’m seventy so I can repeat it. But the fact is, I’m exhausted.”\\n\\n“So get yourself a good night’s sleep, Dad,” said Raych, smiling. “That’s an easy cure.”\\n\\n',\n",
              " '“I don’t know how well I can relax when I have to see our great leader in a few days.”\\n\\n“Not alone, you won’t see him,” said Dors Venabili grimly.\\n\\nSeldon frowned. “Don’t say that again, Dors. It is important for me to see him alone.”\\n\\n“It won’t be safe with you alone. Do you remember what happened ten years ago when \\nyou refused to let me come with you to greet the gardeners?”\\n\\n“There is no danger of my forgetting when you remind me of it twice a week, Dors. In \\nthis case, though, I intend to go alone. What can he want to do to me if I come in as an \\nold man, utterly harmless, to find out what he wants?”\\n\\n“What do you imagine he wants?” said Raych, biting at his knuckle.\\n\\n“I suppose he wants what Cleon always wanted. It will turn out that he has found out \\nthat psychohistory can, in some way, predict the future and he will want to use it for his \\nown purposes. I told Cleon the science wasn’t up to it nearly thirty years ago and I kept \\ntelling him that all through my tenure as First Minister--and now I’ll have to tell General \\nTennar the same thing.”\\n\\n“How do you know he’ll believe you?” said Raych.\\n\\n“I’ll think of some way of being convincing.”\\n\\nDors said, “I do not wish you to go alone.”\\n\\n“Your wishing, Dors, makes no difference.”\\n\\nAt this point, Tamwile Elar interrupted. He said, “I’m the only nonfamily person here. I \\ndon’t know if a comment from me would be welcome.”\\n\\n“Go ahead,” said Seldon. “Come one, come all.”\\n\\n“I would like to suggest a compromise. Why don’t a number of us go with the Maestro. \\nQuite a few of us. We can act as his triumphal escort, a kind of finale to the birthday \\ncelebration. --Now wait, I don’t mean that we will all crowd into the General’s offices. I \\ndon’t even mean entering the Imperial Palace grounds. We can just take hotel rooms in \\nthe Imperial Sector at the edge of the grounds--the Dome’s Edge Hotel would be just \\nright--and we’ll give ourselves a day of pleasure.”\\n\\n“That’sjust what I need,” snorted Seldon. “A day of pleasure.”\\n\\n',\n",
              " '“Not you, Maestro,” said Elar at once. “You’ll be meeting with General Tennar. The rest \\nof us, though, will give the people of the Imperial Sector a notion of your popularity--\\nand perhaps the General will take note also. And if he knows we’re all waiting for your \\nreturn, it may keep him from being unpleasant.”\\n\\nThere was a considerable silence after that. Finally Raych said, “It sounds too showy to \\nme. It don’t fit in with the image the world has of Dad.”\\n\\nBut Dors said, “I’m not interested in Hari’simage . I’m interested in Hari’ssafety . It \\nstrikes me that if we cannot invade the General’s presence or the Imperial grounds, then \\nallowing ourselves to accumulate, so to speak, as near the General as we can, might do \\nus well. Thank you, Dr. Elar, for a very good suggestion.”\\n\\n“I don’t want it done,” said Seldon.\\n\\n“But I do,” said Dors, “and if that’s as close as I can get to offering you personal \\nprotection, then that much I will insist on.”\\n\\nManella, who had listened to it all without comment till then, said, “Visiting the Dome’s \\nEdge Hotel could be a lot of fun.”\\n\\n“It’s not fun I’m thinking of,” said Dors, “but I’ll accept your vote in favor.”\\n\\nAnd so it was. The following day some twenty of the higher echelon of the \\nPsychohistory Project descended on the Dome’s Edge Hotel, with rooms overlooking the \\nopen spaces of the Imperial Palace grounds.\\n\\nThe following evening Hari Seldon was picked up by the General’s armed guards and \\ntaken off to the meeting.\\n\\nAt almost the same time Dors Venabili disappeared, but her absence was not noted for a \\nlong time. And when it was noted, no one could guess what had happened to her and the \\ngaily festive mood turned rapidly into apprehension.\\n\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\n 14\\n\\n      Dors Venabili had lived on the Imperial Palace grounds for ten years. As wife of the \\n\\n',\n",
              " 'First Minister, she had entry to the grounds and could pass freely from the dome to the \\nopen, with her fingerprints as the pass.\\n\\nIn the confusion that followed Cleon’s assassination, her pass had never been removed \\nand now when, for the first time since that dreadful clay, she wanted to move from the \\ndome into the open spaces of the grounds, she could do so.\\n\\nShe had always known that she could do so easily only once, for, upon discovery, the \\npass would be canceled--but this was the one time to do it.\\n\\nThere was a sudden darkening of the sky as she moved into the open ;rod she felt a \\ndistinct lowering of the temperature. The world under the dome was always kept a little \\nlighter during the night period than natural night would require and was kept a little \\ndimmer during the day period. And, of course, the temperature beneath the dome was \\nalways a bit milder than the outdoors.\\n\\nMost Trantorians were unaware of this, for they spent their entire lives under the dome. \\nTo Dors it was expected, but it didn’t really matter.\\n\\nShe took the central roadway, into which the dome opened at the site of the Dome’s \\nEdge Hotel. It was, of course, brightly lit, so that the darkness of the sky didn’t matter at \\nall.\\n\\nDors knew that she would not advance a hundred meters along the roadway without \\nbeing stopped, less perhaps in the present paranoid lays of the junta. Her alien presence \\nwould be detected at once.\\n\\nNor was she disappointed. A small ground-car skittered up and the guardsman shouted \\nout the window, “What are you doing here? Where are you going?”\\n\\nDors ignored the question and continued to walk.\\n\\nThe guardsman called out, “Halt!” Then he slammed on the brakes and stepped out of \\nthe car, which was exactly what Dors had wanted him to do.\\n\\nThe guardsman was holding a blaster loosely in his hand--not threatening to use it, \\nmerely demonstrating its existence. He said, “Your reference number.”\\n\\nDors said, “I want your car.”\\n\\n“What!” The guardsman sounded outraged. “Your reference number. Immediately!” And \\nnow the blaster came up.\\n\\n',\n",
              " 'Dors said quietly, “You don’t need my reference number,” then she walked toward the \\nguardsman.\\n\\nThe guardsman took a backward step. “If you don’t stop and present your reference \\nnumber, I’ll blast you.”\\n\\n“No! Drop your blaster.”\\n\\nThe guardsman’s lips tightened. His finger began to edge toward the contact, but before \\nhe could reach it, he was lost.\\n\\nHe could never describe afterward what happened in any accurate way. All he could say \\nwas “How was I to know it was The Tiger Woman?” (The time came when he would be \\nproud of the encounter.) “She moved so fast, I didn’t see exactly what she did or what \\nhappened. One moment I was going to shoot her down--I was sure she was some sort of \\nmadwoman--and the next thing I knew, I was completely overwhelmed.”\\n\\nDors held the guardsman in a firm grip, the hand with the blaster forced high. She said, \\n“Either drop the blaster at once or I will break your arm.”\\n\\nThe guardsman felt a kind of death grip around his chest that all but prevented him from \\nbreathing. Realizing he had no choice, he dropped the blaster.\\n\\nDors Venabili released him, but before the guardsman could make a move to recover, he \\nfound himself facing his own blaster in Dors’s hand.\\n\\nDors said, “I hope you’ve left your detectors in place. Don’t try to report what’s \\nhappened too quickly. You had better wait and decide what it is you plan to tell your \\nsuperiors. The fact that an unarmed woman took your blaster and your car may well put \\nan end to your usefulness to the junta.”\\n\\nDors started the car and began to speed down the central roadway. A ten-year stay on the \\ngrounds told her exactly where she was going. The car she was in--an official ground-\\ncar--was not an alien intrusion into the grounds and would not be picked up as a matter \\nof course. However, she had to take a chance on speed, for she wanted to reach her \\ndestination rapidly. She pushed the car to a speed of two hundred kilometers per hour.\\n\\nThe speed, at least, eventually did attract attention. She ignored radioed cries, \\ndemanding to know why she was speeding, and before long the car’s detectors told her \\nthat another ground-car was in hot pursuit.\\n\\n',\n",
              " 'She knew that there would be a warning sent up ahead and that there would be other \\nground-cars waiting for her to arrive, but there was little any of them could do, short of \\ntrying to blast her out of existence--something apparently no one was willing to try, \\npending further investigation.\\n\\nWhen she reached the building she had been heading for, two ground-cars were waiting \\nfor her. She climbed serenely out of her own car and walked toward the entrance.\\n\\nTwo men at once stood in her way, obviously astonished that the driver of the speeding \\ncar was not a guardsman but a woman dressed in civilian clothes.\\n\\n“What are you doing here? What was the rush?”\\n\\nDors said quietly, “Important message for Colonel Header Linn.”\\n\\n“Is that so?” said the guardsman harshly. There were now four men between her and the \\nentrance. “Reference number, please.”\\n\\nDors said, “Don’t delay me.”\\n\\n“Reference number, I said.”\\n\\n“You’re wasting my time.”\\n\\nOne of the guardsmen said suddenly, “You know who she looks like? The old First \\nMinister’s wife. Dr. Venabili. The Tiger Woman.”\\n\\nThere was an odd backward step on the part of all four, but one of them said, “You’re \\nunder arrest.”\\n\\n“Am I?” said Dors. “If I’m The Tiger Woman, you must know that I am considerably \\nstronger than any of you and that my reflexes are considerably faster. Let me suggest \\nthat all four of you accompany me quietly inside and we’ll see what Colonel Linn has to \\nsay.”\\n\\n“You’re under arrest” came the repetition and four Masters were aimed at Dors.\\n\\n“Well,” said Dors. “If you insist.”\\n\\nShe moved rapidly and two of the guardsmen were suddenly on the ground, groaning, \\nwhile Dors was standing with a blaster in each hand.\\n\\n',\n",
              " 'She said, “I have tried not to hurt them, but it is quite possible that I Dave broken their \\nwrists. That leaves two of you and I can shoot faster than you can. If either of you makes \\nthe slightest move--the slightest--I will have to break the habit of a lifetime and kill you. \\nIt will sicken me to do so and I beg you not to force me into it.”\\n\\nThere was absolute silence from the two guardsmen still standing--no motion.\\n\\n“I would suggest,” said Dors, “that you two escort me into the colonel’s presence and \\nthat you then seek medical help for your comrades.”\\n\\nThe suggestion was not necessary. Colonel Linn emerged from his office. “What is \\ngoing on here? What is--”\\n\\nDors turned to him. “Ah! Let me introduce myself. I am Dr. Dors Venabili, the wife of \\nProfessor Hari Seldon. I have come to see you on important business. These four tried to \\nstop me and, as a result, two are badly hurt. Send them all about their business and let \\nme talk to you. I mean you no harm.”\\n\\nLinn stared at the four guardsmen, then at Dors. He said calmly, “You mean me no \\nharm? Though four guardsmen have not succeeded in stopping you, I have four \\nthousand at my instant call.”\\n\\n“Then call them,” said Dors. “However quickly they come, it will not be in time to save \\nyou, should I decide to kill you. Dismiss your guardsmen and let us talk civilly.”\\n\\nLinn dismissed the guardsmen and said, “Well, come in and we will talk. Let me warn \\nyou, though, Dr. Venabili--I have a long memory.”\\n\\n“And I,” said Dors. They walked into Linn’s quarters together.\\n\\n      Linn said with utmost courtesy, “Tell me exactly why you are here, Dr. Venabili.”\\n\\nDors smiled without menace--and yet not exactly pleasantly, either. “To begin with,” she \\nsaid, “I have come here to show you that Ican come here.”\\n\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\n 15\\n\\n“Ah?”\\n\\n',\n",
              " '“Yes. My husband was taken to his interview with the General in an official ground-car \\nunder armed guard.

I had to wade through \\nfive guardsmen, including the guardsman whose car I appropriated, in order to reach \\nyou. I would have waded through fifty.”\\n\\nLinn nodded his head phlegmatically. “I understand that you are sometimes called The \\nTiger Woman.”\\n\\n“I have been called that. --Now, having reached you, my task is to make certain that no \\nharm comes to my husband. He is venturing into the General’s lair--if I can be dramatic \\nabout it--and I want him to emerge unharmed and unthreatened.”\\n\\n“As far as I am concerned, I know that no harm will come to your husband as a result of \\nthis meeting. But if you are concerned, why do you come to me? Why didn’t you go \\ndirectly to the General?”\\n\\n“Because, of the two of you, it is you that has the brains.”\\n\\nThere was a short pause and Linn said, “That would be a most dangerous remark--if \\noverheard.”\\n\\n“More dangerous for you than for me, so make sure it is not overheard. --Now, if it \\noccurs to you that I am to be simply soothed and put off and that, if my husband is \\nimprisoned or marked for execution, that there will really be nothing I can do about it, \\ndisabuse yourself.”\\n\\nShe indicated the two blasters that lay on the table before her. “I entered the grounds \\nwith nothing. I arrived in your immediate vicinity with two Masters. If I had no Masters, \\nI might have had knives, with which I am an expert.

This table we’re sitting at is metal--\\nobviously--and sturdy.”\\n\\n“It is.”\\n\\nDors held up her hands, fingers splayed, as if to show that she held no weapon. Then she \\ndropped them to the table and, palms down, caressed its surface.\\n\\nAbruptly Dors raised her fist and then brought it down on the table with a loud crash, \\nwhich sounded almost as if metal were striking metal.

Nevertheless, if Professor Seldon is harmed--”\\n\\n“You are still threatening.”\\n\\n“I am promising. I will do nothing if Professor Seldon is unharmed. Otherwise, Colonel \\nLinn, I will be forced to maim or kill you and--I promise you again--I will do the same \\nto General Tennar.”\\n\\nLinn said, “You cannot withstand an entire army, no matter how tigerish a woman you \\nare. What then?”\\n\\n“Stories spread,” said Dors, “and are exaggerated. I have not really done much in the \\nway of tigerishness, but many more stories are told of me than are true. Your guardsmen \\nfell back when they recognized me and they themselves will spread the story, with \\nadvantage, of how I made my way to you. Even an army might hesitate to attack me, \\nColonel Linn, but even if they did and even if they destroyed me, beware the indignation \\nof the people. The junta is maintaining order, but it is doing so only barely and you don’t \\nwant anything to upset matters. Think, then, of how easy the alternative is. Simply do \\nnot harm Professor Hari Seldon.”\\n\\n“We have no intention of harming him.”\\n\\n“Why the interview, then?”\\n\\n“What’s the mystery? The General is curious about psychohistory. The government \\nrecords are open to us. The old Emperor Cleon was interested. Demerzel, when he was \\nFirst Minister, was interested. Why should we not be in our turn? In fact, more so.”\\n\\n“Why more so?”\\n\\n“Because time has passed. As I understand it, psychohistory began as a thought in \\nProfessor Seldon’s mind. He has been working on it, with increasing vigor and with \\nlarger and larger groups of people, for nearly thirty years. He has done so almost entirely \\nwith government support, so that, in a way, his discoveries and techniques belong to the \\ngovernment. We intend to ask him about psychohistory, which, by now, must be far \\nadvanced beyond what existed in the times of Demerzel and Cleon, and we expect him \\nto tell us what we want to know. We want something more practical than the vision of \\nequations curling their way through air. Do you understand me?”\\n\\n',\n",
              " '“Yes,” said Dors, frowning.\\n\\n“And one more thing. Do not suppose that the danger to your husband comes from the \\ngovernment only and that any harm that reaches him will mean that you must attack us \\nat once. I would suggest that Professor Seldon may have purely private enemies. I have \\nno knowledge of such things, but surely it is possible.”\\n\\n“I shall keep that in mind. Right now, I want to have you arrange that I join my husband \\nduring his interview with the General. I want to know, beyond doubt, that he is safe.”\\n\\n“That will be hard to arrange and will take some time. It would be impossible to \\ninterrupt the conversation, but if you wait till it is ended--”\\n\\n“Take the time and arrange it. Do not count on double-crossing me and remaining alive.”\\n\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\n 16\\n\\n      General Tennar stared at Hari Seldon in a rather pop-eyed manner and his fingers \\ntapped lightly at the desk where he sat.\\n\\n“Thirty years,” he said. “Thirty years and you are telling me you still have nothing to \\nshow for it?”\\n\\n“Actually, General, twenty-eight years.”\\n\\nTennar ignored that. “And all at government expense. Do you know how many billions \\nof credits have been invested in your Project, Professor?”\\n\\n“I haven’t kept up, General, but we have records that could give me the answer to your \\nquestion in seconds.”\\n\\n“And so have we. The government, Professor, is not an endless source of funds. These \\nare not the old times. We don’t have Cleon’s old Free-and-easy attitude toward finances. \\nRaising taxes is hard and we need credits for many things. I have called you here, \\nhoping that you can benefit us in some way with your psychohistory. If you cannot, then \\nI must tell you, quite frankly, that we will have to shut off the faucet. If you ran continue \\nyour research without government funding, do so, for unless you show me something \\nthat would make the expense worth it, you will have to do just that.”\\n\\n',\n",
              " '“General, you make a demand I cannot meet, but, if in response, you and government \\nsupport, you will be throwing away the future. Give me wile and eventually--”\\n\\n“Various governments have heard that ‘eventually’ from you for decades. Isn’t it true, \\nProfessor, that you say your psychohistory predicts that the junta is unstable, that my \\nrule is unstable, that in a short time it will collapse?”\\n\\nSeldon frowned. “The technique is not yet firm enough for me to say that this is \\nsomething that psychohistory states.”\\n\\n“I put it to you that psychohistory does state it and that this is common knowledge \\nwithin your Project.”\\n\\n“No,” said Seldon warmly. “No such thing. It is possible that some among us have \\ninterpreted some relationships to indicate that the junta may be an unstable form of \\ngovernment, but there are other relationships that may easily be interpreted to show it is \\nstable. That is the reason why we must continue our work. At the present moment it is \\nall too easy to use incomplete data and imperfect reasoning to reach any conclusion we \\nwish.”\\n\\n“But if you decide to present the conclusion that the government is unstable and say that \\npsychohistory warrants it--even if it does not actually do so--will it not add to the \\ninstability?”\\n\\n“It may very well do that, General. And if we announced that the government is stable, it \\nmay well add to the stability. I have had this very same discussion with Emperor Cleon \\non a number of occasions. It is possible to use psychohistory as a tool to manipulate the \\nemotions of the people and achieve short-term effects. In the long run, however, the \\npredictions are quite likely to prove incomplete or downright erroneous and \\npsychohistory will lose all its credibility and it will be as though it had never existed.”\\n\\n“Enough! Tell me straight out! What do you think psychohistory shows about my \\ngovernment?”\\n\\n“It shows, we think, that there are elements of instability in it, but we are not certain--\\nand cannot be certain--exactly in what way this can be made worse or made better.”\\n\\n“In other words, psychohistory simply tells you what you would know without \\npsychohistory and it is that in which government has invested uncounted piles of \\ncredits.”\\n\\n',\n",
              " '“The time will come when psychohistory will tell us what we could not know without it \\nand then the investment will pay itself back many, many times over.”\\n\\n“And how long will it be before that time comes?”\\n\\n“Not too long, I hope. We have been making rather gratifying progress in the last few \\nyears.”\\n\\nTennar was tapping his fingernail on his desk again. “Not enough. Tell me something \\nhelpful now. Something useful.”\\n\\nSeldon pondered, then said, “I can prepare a detailed report for you, but it will take \\ntime.”\\n\\n“Of course it will. Days, months, years--and somehow it will never be written. Do you \\ntake me for a fool?”\\n\\n“No, of course not, General. However, I don’t want to be taken for a fool, either. I can \\ntell you something that I will take sole responsibility for. I have seen it in my \\npsychohistorical research, but I may have misinterpreted what I saw. However, since you \\ninsist--”\\n\\n“I insist.”\\n\\n“You mentioned taxes a little while ago. You said raising taxes was difficult. Certainly. It \\nis always difficult. Every government must do its work by collecting wealth in one form \\nor another. The only two ways in which such credits can be obtained are, first, by \\nrobbing a neighbor, or second, persuading a government’s own citizens to grant the \\ncredits willingly and peaceably.\\n\\n“Since we have established a Galactic Empire that has been conducting its business in \\nreasonable fashion for thousands of years, there is no possibility of robbing a neighbor, \\nexcept as the result of an occasional rebellion and its repression. This does not happen \\noften enough to support a government--and, if it did, the government would be too \\nunstable to last long, in any case.”\\n\\nSeldon drew a deep breath and went on. “Therefore, credits must be raised by asking the \\ncitizens to hand over part of their wealth for government use. Presumably, since the \\ngovernment will then work efficiently, the citizens can better spend their credits in this \\nway than to hoard it--each man to himself-while living in a dangerous and chaotic \\nanarchy.\\n\\n',\n",
              " '“However, though the request is reasonable and the citizenry is better off paying taxes as \\ntheir price for maintaining a stable and efficient government, they are nevertheless \\nreluctant to do so. In order to overcome this reluctance, governments must make it \\nappear that they are not taking too many credits, and that they are considering each \\ncitizen’s rights and benefits. In other words, they must lower the percentage taken out of \\nlow incomes; they must allow deductions of various kinds to be made before the tax is \\nassessed, and so on.\\n\\n“As time goes on, the tax situation inevitably grows more and more complex as different \\nworlds, different sectors within each world, and different economic divisions all demand \\nand require special treatment. Me result is that the tax-collecting branch of the \\ngovernment grows in size and complexity and tends to become uncontrollable. The \\naverage citizen cannot understand why or how much he is being taxed; what he can get \\naway with and what he can’t. The government and the tax agency itself are often in the \\ndark as well.\\n\\n“What’s more, an ever-larger fraction of the funds collected must be put into running the \\noverelaborate tax agency--maintaining records, pursuing tax delinquents--so the amount \\nof credits available for good ,end useful purposes declines despite anything we can do.\\n\\n“In the end, the tax situation becomes overwhelming. It inspires discontent and \\nrebellion. The history books tend to ascribe these things to greedy businessmen, to \\ncorrupt politicians, to brutal warriors, to ambitious viceroys--but these are just the \\nindividuals who take advantage of the tax overgrowth.”\\n\\nThe General said harshly, “Are you telling me that our tax system is overcomplicated?”\\n\\nSeldon said, “If it were not, it would be the only one in history that wasn’t, as far as I \\nknow. If there is one thing that psychohistory tells me is inevitable, it is tax overgrowth.”\\n\\n“And what do we do about it?”\\n\\n“That I cannot tell you. It is that for which I would like to prepare a report that--as you \\nsay--may take a while to get ready.”\\n\\n“Never mind the report. The tax system is overcomplicated, isn’t it? Isn’t that what you \\nare saying?”\\n\\n“It is possible that it is,” said Seldon cautiously.\\n\\n“And to correct that, one must make the tax system simpler--as simple as possible, in \\nfact.”\\n\\n',\n",
              " '“I would have to study--”\\n\\n“Nonsense. The opposite of great complication is great simplicity. I don’t need a report \\nto tell me that.”\\n\\n“As you say, General,” said Seldon.\\n\\nAt this point the General looked up suddenly, as though he had been called--as, indeed, \\nhe had been. His fists clenched and holovision images of Colonel Linn and Dors \\nVenabili suddenly appeared in the room.\\n\\nThunderstruck, Seldon exclaimed, “Dors! What are you doing here?”\\n\\nThe General said nothing, but his brow furrowed into a frown.\\n\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\n 17\\n\\n      The General had had a bad night and so, out of apprehension, had the colonel. They \\nfaced each other now--each at a loss.\\n\\nThe General said, “Tell me again what this woman did.”\\n\\nLinn seemed to have a heavy weight on his shoulders. “She’s The Tiger Woman. That’s \\nwhat they call her. She doesn’t seem to be quite human, somehow. She’s some sort of \\nimpossibly trained athlete, full of self-confidence, and, General, she’s quite frightening.”\\n\\n“Did she frightenyou ? A single woman?”\\n\\n“Let me tell you exactly what she did and let me tell you a few other things about her. I \\ndon’t know how true all the stories about her are, but what happened yesterday evening \\nis true enough.”\\n\\nHe told the story again and the General listened, puffing out his cheeks.\\n\\n“Bad,” he said. “What do we do?”\\n\\n“I think our course is plain before us. We want psychohistory--”\\n\\n',\n",
              " '“Yes, we do,” said the General. “Seldon told me something about taxation that-- But \\nnever mind. That is beside the point at the moment. Go on.”\\n\\nLinn, who, in his troubled state of mind, had allowed a small fragment of impatience to \\nshow on his face, continued, “As I say, we want psychohistory without Seldon. He is, in \\nany case, a used-up man. The more I study him, the more I see an elderly scholar who is \\nliving on his past deeds. He has had nearly thirty years to make a success of \\npsychohistory and he has failed. Without him, with new men at the helm, psychohistory \\nmay advance more rapidly.”\\n\\n“Yes, I agree. Now what about the woman?”\\n\\n“Well, there you are. We haven’t taken her into consideration because she has been \\ncareful to remain in the background. But I strongly suspect now that it will be difficult, \\nperhaps impossible, to remove Seldon quietly and without implicating the government, \\nas long as the woman remains alive.”\\n\\n“Do you really believe that she will mangle you and me--if she thinks we have harmed \\nher man?” said the General, his mouth twisting in contempt.\\n\\n“I really think she will and that she will start a rebellion as well. It will he exactly as she \\npromised.”\\n\\n“You are turning into a coward.”\\n\\n“General, please. I am trying to be sensible. I’m not backing off. We must take care of \\nthis Tiger Woman.” He paused thoughtfully. “As a matter of fact, my sources have told \\nme this and I admit to having paid far too little attention to the matter.”\\n\\n“And how do you think we can get rid of her?”\\n\\nLinn said, “I don’t know.” Then, more slowly, “But someone else might.”\\n\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\n 18\\n\\n      Seldon had had a bad night also, nor was the new day promising to be much better. \\nThere weren’t too many times when Hari felt annoyed with Dors.

That alone would have been sufficient to drive a paranoid ruler into \\nthoughts of some sort of conspiracy.”\\n\\n“How? We were unarmed, Hari. It was a holiday affair, the final touch of your birthday \\ncelebration. We posed no threat.”\\n\\n“Yes, but then you carried out your invasion of the Palace grounds. It was unforgivable. \\nYou raced to the Palace to interfere with my session with the General, when I had \\nspecifically--and several times--made it plain that I didn’t want you there. I had my own \\nplans, you know.”\\n\\nDors said, “Your desires and your orders and your plans all take second place to your \\nsafety. I was primarily concerned about that.”\\n\\n“I was in no danger.”\\n\\n“That is not something I can carelessly assume. There have been two attempts on your \\nlife. What makes you think there won’t be a third?”\\n\\n“The two attempts were made when I was First Minister. I was probably worth killing \\nthen. Who would want to kill an elderly mathematician?”\\n\\nDors said, “That’s exactly what I want to find out and that’s what I want to stop. I must \\nbegin by doing some questioning right here at the Project.”\\n\\n“No. You will simply be upsetting my people. Leave them alone.”\\n\\n“That’s exactly what I can’t do. Hari, my job is to protect you and for twenty-eight years \\nI’ve been working at that. You cannot stop me now.”\\n\\nSomething in the blaze of her eyes made it quite clear that, whatever Seldon’s desires or \\norders might be, Dors intended to do as she pleased.\\n\\nSeldon’s safety came first.\\n\\n  \\n\\n 19\\n\\n',\n",
              " '  \\n\\n      “May I interrupt you, Yugo?”\\n\\n“Of course, Dors,” said Yugo Amaryl with a large smile. “You are lover an interruption. \\nWhat can I do for you?”\\n\\n“I am trying to find out a few things, Yugo, and I wonder if you would humor me in \\nthis.”\\n\\n“If I can.”\\n\\n“You have something in the Project called the Prime Radiant. I hear it now and then. \\nHari speaks of it, so I imagine I know what it looks like when it is activated, but I have \\nnever actually seen it in operation. I would like to.”\\n\\nAmaryl looked uncomfortable. “Actually the Prime Radiant is just about the most \\nclosely guarded part of the Project and you aren’t on the list of the members who have \\naccess.”\\n\\n“I know that, but we’ve known each other for twenty-eight years--”\\n\\n“And you’re Hari’s wife. I suppose we can stretch a point. We only have two full Prime \\nRadiants. There’s one in Hari’s office and one here. Right there, in fact.”\\n\\nDors looked at the squat black cube on the central desk. It looked utterly \\nundistinguished. “Is that it?”\\n\\n“That’s it. It stores the equations that describe the future.”\\n\\n“How do you get at those equations?”\\n\\nAmaryl moved a contact and at once the room darkened and then came to life in a \\nvariegated glow. All around Dors were symbols, arrows, mathematical signs of one sort \\nor another. They seemed to be moving, spiraling, but when she focused her eyes on any \\nparticular portion, it seemed to be standing still.\\n\\nShe said, “Is that the future, then?”\\n\\n“It may be,” said Amaryl, turning off the instrument. “I had it at full expansion so you \\ncould see the symbols. Without expansion, nothing is visible but patterns of light and \\ndark.”\\n\\n',\n",
              " '“And by studying those equations, you are able to judge what the future holds in store \\nfor us?”\\n\\n“In theory.” The room was now back to its mundane appearance. “But there are two \\ndifficulties.”\\n\\n“Oh? What are they?”\\n\\n“To begin with, no human mind has created those equations directly. We have merely \\nspent decades programming more powerful computers and they have devised and stored \\nthe equations, but, of course, we don’t know if they are valid and have meaning. It \\ndepends entirely on how valid and meaningful the programming is in the first place.”\\n\\n“They could be all wrong, then?”\\n\\n“They could be.” Amaryl rubbed his eyes and Dors could not help thinking how old and \\ntired he seemed to have grown in the last couple of years. He was younger than Hari by \\nnearly a dozen years, but he seemed much older.\\n\\n“Of course,” Amaryl went on in a rather weary voice, “we hope that they aren’t all \\nwrong, but that’s where the second difficulty comes in. Although Hari and I have been \\ntesting and modifying them for decades, we can never be sure what the equations mean. \\nThe computer has constructed them, so it is to be presumed they must mean something--\\nbut what? There are portions that we think we have worked out. In fact, right now, I’m \\nworking on what we call Section A-23, a particularly knotty system of relationships. We \\nhave not yet been able to match it with anything in the real Universe. Still, each year \\nsees us further advanced and I look forward confidently to the establishment of \\npsychohistory as a legitimate and useful technique for dealing with the future.”\\n\\n“How many people have access to these Prime Radiants?”\\n\\n“Every mathematician in the Project has access but not at will. There have to be \\napplications and time allotted and the Prime Radiant has to be adjusted to the portion of \\nthe equations a mathematician wishes to refer to. It gets a little complicated when \\neveryone wants to use the Prime Radiant at the same time. Right now, things are slow, \\npossibly because we’re still in the aftermath of Hari’s birthday celebration.”\\n\\n“Is there any plan for constructing additional Prime Radiants?”\\n\\nAmaryl thrust out his lips. “Yes and no. It would be very helpful if we had a third, but \\nsomeone would have to be in charge of it. It can’t just be a community possession. I \\n\\n',\n",

Perhaps Linn never saw the Prime Radiant but was merely told about it.”\\n\\n“Who would tell him about it?”\\n\\nAmaryl thought a moment and said, “No one.”\\n\\n“Well now, you talked about internal politics a while ago in connection with the \\npossibility of Elar having a third Prime Radiant.

He has to deal with them \\nin one way or another and I can well imagine what a headache it must be for him.”\\n\\n“Are these feuds so bad that they interfere with the working of the Project?”\\n\\n“Not seriously.”\\n\\n“Are there any people who are more quarrelsome than others or any duo draw more \\nresentment than others? In short, are there people you can get rid of and perhaps remove \\n90 percent of the friction at the cost of 5 or 6 percent of the personnel?”\\n\\nAmaryl raised his eyebrows. “It sounds like a good idea, but I don’t know whom to get \\nrid of. I don’t really participate in all the minutiae of internal politics. There’s no way of \\nstopping it, so for my part, I merely avoid it.”\\n\\n“That’s strange,” said Dors. “Aren’t you in this way denying any credibility to \\npsychohistory?”\\n\\n“In what way?”\\n\\n“How can you pretend to reach a point where you can predict and guide the future, when \\nyou cannot analyze and correct something as homegrown as personal frictions in the \\nvery Project that promises so much?”\\n\\nAmaryl chuckled softly. It was unusual, for he was not a man who was given to humor \\nand laughter. “I’m sorry, Dors, but you picked on the one problem that we have solved, \\nafter a manner of speaking. Hari himself identified the equations that represented the \\ndifficulties of personal friction years ago and I myself then added the final touch last \\nyear.\\n\\n“I found that there were ways in which the equations could be changed so as to indicate \\na reduction in friction. In every such case, however, a reduction in friction here meant an \\nincrease in friction there. Never at any time was there a total decrease or, for that matter, \\na total increase in the friction within a closed group--that is, one in which no old \\nmembers leave and no new members come in. What I proved, with the help of Elar’s \\nachaotic equations, was that this was true despite any conceivable action anyone could \\ntake. Hari calls it ‘the law of conservation of personal problems.’\\n\\n“It gave rise to the notion that social dynamics has its conservation laws as physics does \\nand that, in fact, it is these laws that offer us the best possible tools for solving the truly \\ntroublesome aspects of psychohistory.”\\n\\n',\n",
              " 'Dors said, “Rather impressive, but what if you end up finding that nothing at all can be \\nchanged, that everything that is bad is conserved, and that to save the Empire from \\ndestruction is merely to increase destruction of another kind?”\\n\\n“Actually some have suggested that, but I don’t believe it.”\\n\\n“Very well. Back to reality. Is there anything in the frictional problems within the Project \\nthat threaten Hari? I mean, with physical harm.”\\n\\n“Harm Hari? Of course not. How can you suggest such a thing?”\\n\\n“Might there not be some who resent Hari, for being too arrogant, too pushy, too self-\\nabsorbed, too eager to grab all the credit? Or, if none of these things apply, might they \\nnot resent him simply because he has run the Project for so long a time?”\\n\\n“I never heard anyone say such a thing about Hari.”\\n\\nDors seemed dissatisfied. “I doubt that anyone would say such things in your hearing, of \\ncourse. But thank you, Yugo, for being so helpful and for giving me so much of your \\ntime.”\\n\\nAmaryl stared after her as she left. He felt vaguely troubled, but then returned to his \\nwork and let other matters drift away.\\n\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\n 20\\n\\n      One way Hari Seldon had (out of not too many ways) for pulling away from his \\nwork for a time was to visit Raych’s apartment, just outside the university grounds. To \\ndo this invariably filled him with love for his foster son. There were ample grounds. \\nRaych had been good, capable, and loyal--but besides that was the strange quality Raych \\nhad of inspiring trust and love in others.\\n\\nHari had observed it when Raych was a twelve-year-old street boy, who somehow pulled \\nat his own and at Dors’s heartstrings. He remembered how Raych had affected Rashelle, \\nthe onetime Mayor of Wye. Hari remembered how Joranum had trusted Raych, which \\nled to his own destruction. Raych had even managed to win the heart of the beautiful \\nManella. Hari did not completely understand this particular quality that Raych \\n\\n',\n",

She’s out shopping with her mother.”\\n\\nSeldon seated himself and looked good-humoredly at the chaos of reference material. \\n“How’s the book coming?”\\n\\n“It’s doing fine. It’s me who might not survive.” He sighed. “But for once, we’ll get the \\nstraight poop on Dahl. Nobody’s ever written a book devoted to that section, wouldja \\nbelieve?”\\n\\nSeldon had always noted that, whenever Raych talked of his home sector, his Dahlite \\naccent always strengthened.\\n\\nRaych said, “And how are you, Dad? Glad the festivities are over?”\\n\\n“Enormously. I hated just about every minute of it.”\\n\\n“Not so anyone could notice.”\\n\\n“Listen, I had to wear a mask of sorts. I didn’t want to spoil the celebration for everyone \\nelse.”\\n\\n“You must have hated it when Mom chased after you onto the Palace grounds. Everyone \\nI know has been talking about that.”\\n\\n“I certainly did hate it. Your mother, Raych, is the most wonderful person in the world, \\nbut she is very difficult to handle. She might have spoiled my plans.”\\n\\n“What plans are those, Dad?”\\n\\nSeldon settled back. It was always pleasant to speak to someone in whom he had total \\ntrust and who knew nothing about psychohistory. More than once he had bounced \\nthoughts off Raych and had worked them out into more sensible forms than would have \\nbeen the case if those same thoughts had been mulled over in his mind. He said, “Are we \\n\\n',\n",
              " 'shielded?”\\n\\n“Always.”\\n\\n“What lines?”\\n\\n“Good. What I did was to set General Tennar thinking along curious lines.”\\n\\n“Well, I discussed taxation a bit and pointed out that, in the effort to make taxation rest \\nevenly on the population, it grew more and more complex, unwieldy, and costly. The \\nobvious implication was that the tax system must be simplified.”\\n\\n“That seems to make sense.”\\n\\n“Up to a point, but it is possible that, as a result of our little discussion, Tennar may \\noversimplify. You see, taxation loses effectiveness at both extremes. Overcomplicate it \\nand people cannot understand it and pay for an overgrown and expensive tax \\norganization. Oversimplify it and people consider it unfair and grow bitterly resentful. \\nThe simplest tax is a poll tax, in which every individual pays the same amount, but the \\nunfairness of treating rich and poor alike in this way is too evident to overlook.”\\n\\n“And you didn’t explain this to the General?”\\n\\n“Somehow, I didn’t get a chance.”\\n\\n“Do you think the General will try a poll tax?”\\n\\n“And you’ve done this on purpose, Dad?”\\n\\n“Of course.”\\n\\n“I think he will plan one. If he does, the news is bound to leak out and that alone would \\nsuffice to set off riots and possibly upset the government.”\\n\\nRaych shook his head. “I don’t quite understand you, Dad. In your personal life, you’re \\nas sweet and gentle as any person in the Empire. Yet you can deliberately set up a \\nsituation in which there will be riots, suppression, deaths. There’ll be a lot of damage \\ndone, Dad. Have you thought of that?”\\n\\nSeldon leaned back in his chair and said sadly, “I think of nothing else, Raych. When I \\nfirst began my work on psychohistory, it seemed a purely academic piece of research to \\nme. It was something that could not he worked out at all, in all likelihood, and, if it was, \\n\\n',\n",
              " 'it would not be something that could be practically applied. But the decades pass and we \\nknow more and more and then comes the terrible urge to apply it.”\\n\\n“So that people can die?”\\n\\n“No, so that fewer people can die. If our psychohistorical analyses are correct now, then \\nthe junta cannot survive for more than a few years and there are various alternative ways \\nin which it can collapse. They will all he fairly bloody and desperate. This method--the \\ntaxation gimmick--should do it more smoothly and gently than any other if--I repeat--\\nour analyses are correct.”\\n\\n“If they’re not correct, what then?”\\n\\n“In that case, we don’t know what might happen. Still, psychohistory must reach the \\npoint where it can be used and we’ve been searching for years for something in which \\nwe have worked out the consequences with a certain assuredness and can find those \\nconsequences tolerable as compared with alternatives. In a way, this taxation gimmick is \\nthe first great psychohistoric experiment.”\\n\\n“I must admit, it sounds like a simple one.”\\n\\n“It isn’t. You have no idea how complex psychohistory is. Nothing is simple. The poll \\ntax has been tried now and then throughout history. It is never popular and it invariably \\ngives rise to resistance of one form or another, but it almost never results in the violent \\noverthrow of a government. After all, the powers of governmental oppression may be \\ntoo strong or there may be methods whereby the people can bring to bear their \\nopposition in a peaceful manner and achieve redress. If a poll tax were invariably or \\neven just sometimes fatal, then no government would ever try it. It is only because it \\nisn’t fatal that it is tried repeatedly. The situation on Trantor is, however, not exactly \\nnormal. There are certain instabilities that seem clear in psychohistorical analysis, which \\nmake it seem that resentment will be particularly strong and repression particularly \\nweak.”\\n\\nRaych sounded dubious. “I hope it works, Dad, but don’t you think that the General will \\nsay that he was working under psychohistorical advice and bring you down with him?”\\n\\n“I suppose he recorded our little session together, but if he publicizes that, it will show \\nclearly that I urged him to wait till I could analyze the situation properly and prepare a \\nreport--and he refused to wait.”\\n\\n“And what does Mom think of all this?”\\n\\n',\n",
              " 'Seldon said, “I haven’t discussed it with her. She’s off on another tangent altogether.”\\n\\n“Really?”\\n\\n“Yes. She’s trying to sniff out some deep conspiracy in the Project--aimed at me! I \\nimagine she thinks there are many people in the Project who would like to get rid of \\nme.” Seldon sighed. “I’m one of them, I think. I would like to get rid of me as director \\nof the Project and leave the gathering responsibilities of psychohistory to others.”\\n\\nRaych said, “What’s bugging Mom is Wanda’s dream. You know how Mom feels about \\nprotecting you.

I have been told some excellent things about you.”\\n\\n“That’s always nice to hear.

My own feeling is that, if I’m prominent, then I’m a prominent member \\nof the Project. It makes no difference that I’m a nonmathematician.”\\n\\n“That certainly sounds reasonable to me. --How long have you been with the Project?”\\n\\n“Two and a half years. Before that I was a graduate student in radiational physics at \\nStreeling and, while I was doing that, I served a couple of years with the Project as an \\nintern.”\\n\\n“You’ve done well at the Project, I understand.”\\n\\n“I’ve been promoted twice, Dr. Venabili.”\\n\\n“Have you encountered any difficulties here, Dr. Monay? --Whatever you say will be \\nheld confidential.”\\n\\n“The work is difficult, of course, but if you mean, have I run into any social difficulties, \\nthe answer is no. At least not any more than one would expect in any large and complex \\nproject, I imagine.”\\n\\n“And by that you mean?”\\n\\n“Occasional spats and quarrels. We’re all human.”\\n\\n“But nothing serious?”\\n\\nMonay shook her head. “Nothing serious.”\\n\\n“My understanding, Dr. Monay,” said Dors, “is that you have been responsible for the \\ndevelopment of a device important to the use of the Prime Radiant. It makes it possible \\nto cram much more information into the Prime Radiant.”\\n\\nMonay broke into a radiant smile. “Do you know about that?--Yes, the Electro-Clarifier. \\nAfter that was developed, Professor Seldon established this small laboratory and put me \\nin charge of other work in that direction.”\\n\\n“I’m amazed that such an important advance did not bring you up into the higher \\nechelons of the Project.”\\n\\n“Oh well,” said Monay, looking a trifle embarrassed. “I don’t want to take all the credit. \\n\\n',\n",
              " 'Actually my work was only that of a technician--a very skilled and creative technician, I \\nlike to think--but there you are.”\\n\\n“And who worked with you?”\\n\\n“Didn’t you know? It was Tamwile Elar. He worked out the theory that made the device \\npossible and I designed and built the actual instrument.”\\n\\n“Does that mean he took the credit, Dr. Monay?”\\n\\n“No no. You mustn’t think that. Dr. Elar is not that kind of man. He gave me full credit \\nfor my share of the work. In fact, it was his idea to call the device by our names--both \\nour names--but he couldn’t.”\\n\\n“Why not?”\\n\\n“Well, that’s Professor Seldon’s rule, you know. All devices and equations are to be \\ngiven functional names and not personal ones--to avoid resentment. So the device is just \\nthe Electro-Clarifier. When we’re working together, however, he gives the device our \\nnames and, I tell you, Dr. Venabili, it sounds grand. Perhaps someday, all of the Project \\npersonnel will use the personal name. I hope so.”\\n\\n“I hope so, too,” said Dors politely. “You make Elar sound like a very decent \\nindividual.”\\n\\n“He is. He is,” said Monay earnestly. “He is a delight to work for. Right now, I’m \\nworking on a new version of the device, which is more powerful and which I don’t quite \\nunderstand. --I mean, what it’s to be used for. However, he’s directing me there.”\\n\\n“And are you making progress?”\\n\\n“Indeed. In fact, I’ve given Dr. Elar a prototype, which he plans to test. If it works out, \\nwe can proceed further.”\\n\\n“It sounds good,” agreed Dors. “What do you think would happen if Professor Seldon \\nwere to resign as director of the Project? If he were to retire?”\\n\\nMonay looked surprised. “Is the professor planning to retire?”\\n\\n“Not that I know of. I’m presenting you with a hypothetical case. Suppose he retires. \\nWho do you think would be a natural successor? I think from what you have said that \\nyou would favor Professor Elar as the new director.”\\n\\n',\n",
              " '“Yes, I would,” responded Monay after a trifling hesitation. “He’s far and away the most \\nbrilliant of the new people and I think he could run the Project in the best possible way. \\nStill, he’s rather young. There are a considerable number of old fossils--well, you know \\nwhat I mean--who would resent being passed over by a young squirt.”\\n\\n“Is there any old fossil you’re thinking of in particular? Remember, this is confidential.”\\n\\n“Quite a few of them, but there’s Dr. Amaryl. He’s the heir apparent.”\\n\\n“Yes, I see what you mean.” Dors rose. “Well, thank you so much for your help.

Yugo, though he’s younger, has been \\nexposed to the Electro-Clarifier more than you have and, as a result, he is more tired, \\nmore crotchety, and, in my opinion, a great deal less in touch than you are. And he is \\nrather childishly intense about the succession. Don’t you see anything significant in \\nthis?”\\n\\n“Age and overwork. That’s significant.”\\n\\n“No, it’s the Electro-Clarifier.

She took over the details and you \\npersuaded her that it was possible to put together a really large celebration. Isn’t that \\nso?”\\n\\n“I don’t know if I had any influence on her, but even if I did, what’s wrong with that?”\\n\\n“In itself, nothing, but in setting up so large and widespread and prolonged a celebration, \\nwere we not advertising to the rather unstable and suspicious men of the junta that Hari \\nwas too popular and might be a danger to them?”\\n\\n“No one could possibly believe such a thing was in my mind.”\\n\\nDors said, “I am merely pointing out the possibility. --In planning the birthday \\ncelebration, you insisted that the central offices be cleared out--”\\n\\n“Temporarily. For obvious reasons.”\\n\\n“--and insisted that they remain totally unoccupied for a while.

I said that you were in a position to use the empty rooms \\nfor private conversations and that you may have been there with a member of the junta.”\\n\\n“That is not even worth a denial.”\\n\\n“But you were overheard. A little girl wandered into the room, curled up in a chair out of \\nsight, and overheard your conversation.”\\n\\nElar frowned. “What did she hear?”\\n\\n“She reported that two men were talking about death.

Yugo, who works with it more, has also suffered more.”\\n\\n“The Electro-Clarifier can, in no way, do that kind of damage.”\\n\\nDors put her hand to her forehead and momentarily winced.

His eyes \\nremained on his screen, but Seldon’s ears were open for the discussion near him. One \\ndidn’t usually hear political discussions in the Library. They were, in point of fact, not \\nsupposed to take place.\\n\\nSeldon did not know any of the three men. That was not entirely surprising. There were \\nhabitues of the Library, quite a few, and Seldon knew most of them by sight--and some \\neven to talk to--but the Library was open to all citizens. No qualifications. Anyone could \\nenter and use its facilities. (For a limited period of time, of course. Only a select few, \\nlike Seldon were allowed to “set up shop” in the Library. Seldon had I1uen granted the \\nuse of a locked private office and complete access to Library resources.)\\n\\nOne of the men (Seldon thought of him as Hook Nose, for obvious reasons) spoke in a \\nlow urgent voice.\\n\\n“Let it go,” he said. “Let it go. It’s costing us a mint to try to hold on and, even if we do, \\nit will only be while they’re there. They can’t stay there forever and, as soon as they \\nleave, the situation will revert to what it was.”\\n\\n',\n",
              " 'Seldon knew what they were talking about. The news had come over TrantorVision only \\nthree days ago that the Imperial government had decided on a show of force to bring the \\nobstreperous Governor of Anacreon into line. Seldon’s own psychohistorical analysis \\nhad shown him that it was a useless procedure, but the government did not generally \\nlisten when its emotions were stirred. Seldon smiled slightly and grimly at hearing Hook \\nNose say what he himself had said--and the young man said it without the benefit of any \\nknowledge of psychohistory.\\n\\nHook Nose went on. “If we leave Anacreon alone, what do we lose? It’s still there, right \\nwhere it always was, right at the edge of the Empire. It can’t pick up and go to \\nAndromeda, can it? So it still has to trade with us and life continues. What’s the \\ndifference if they salute the Emperor or not? You’ll never be able to tell the difference.”\\n\\nThe second man, whom Seldon had labeled Baldy, for even more obvious reasons, said, \\n“Except this whole business doesn’t exist in a vacuum. If Anacreon goes, the other \\nborder provinces will go. The Empire will break up.”\\n\\n“So what?” whispered Hook Nose fiercely. “The Empire can’t run itself effectively \\nanymore, anyway. It’s too big. Let the border go and take care of itself--if it can. The \\nInner Worlds will be all the stronger and better off. The border doesn’t have to be ours \\npolitically; it will still be ours economically.”\\n\\nAnd now the third man (Red Cheeks) said, “I wish you were right, but that’s not the way \\nit’s going to work. If the border provinces establish their independence, the first thing \\neach will do will be to try to increase its power at the expense of its neighbors. There’ll \\nbe war and conflict and every one of the governors will dream of becoming Emperor at \\nlast. It will be like the old days before the Kingdom of Trantor--a dark age that will last \\nfor thousands of years.”\\n\\nBaldy said, “Surely things won’t bethat bad. The Empire may break up, but it will heal \\nitself quickly when people find out that the breakup just means war and impoverishment. \\nThey’ll look back on the golden days of the intact Empire and all will be well again. \\nWe’re not barbarians, you know. We’ll find a way.”\\n\\n“Absolutely,” said Hook Nose. “We’ve got to remember that the Empire has faced crisis \\nafter crisis in its history and has pulled through time and again.”\\n\\nBut Red Cheeks shook his head as he said, “This is not just another crisis. This is \\nsomething much worse. The Empire has been deteriorating for generations. Ten years’ \\nworth of the junta destroyed the economy and since the fall of the junta and the rise of \\nthis new Emperor, the Empire has been so weak that the governors on the Periphery \\n\\n',\n",
              " 'don’t have to do anything. It’s going to fall of its own weight.”\\n\\n“And the allegiance to the Emperor--” began Hook Nose.\\n\\n“What allegiance?” said Red Cheeks. “We went for years without an Emperor after \\nCleon was assassinated and no one seemed to mind much. And this new Emperor is just \\na figurehead. There’s nothing he can do. There’s nothing anyone can do. This isn’t a \\ncrisis. This is theend .”\\n\\nThe other two stared at Red Cheeks, frowning. Baldy said, “You really believe it! You \\nthink that the Imperial government will just sit there and let it all happen?”\\n\\n“Yes! Like you two, they won’t believe it is happening. That is, until it’s too late.”\\n\\n“What would you want them to do if they did believe it?” asked Baldy.\\n\\nRed Cheeks stared into the Galactograph, as if he might find an answer there. “I don’t \\nknow. Look, in due course of time I’ll die; things won’t be too bad by then. Afterward, \\nas the situation gets worse, other people can worry about it. I’ll be gone. And so will the \\ngood old days. Maybe forever. I’m not the only one who thinks this, by the way. Ever \\nhear of someone named Hari Seldon?”\\n\\n“Sure,” said Hook Nose at once. “Wasn’t he First Minister under Cleon?”\\n\\n“Yes,” said Red Cheeks. “He’s some sort of scientist. I heard him give a talk a few \\nmonths back. It felt good to know I’m not theonly one who believes the Empire is \\nfalling apart. He said--”\\n\\n“And he said everything’s going to pot and there’s going to be a permanent dark age?” \\nBaldy interjected.\\n\\n“Well no,” said Red Cheeks. “He’s one of these real cautious types. Ire says itmight \\nhappen, but he’s wrong. Itwill happen.”\\n\\nSeldon had heard enough. He limped toward the table where the three men sat and \\ntouched Red Cheeks on the shoulder.\\n\\n“Sir,” he said, “may I speak to you for a moment?”\\n\\nStartled, Red Cheeks looked up and then he said, “Hey, aren’t you Professor Seldon?”\\n\\n“I always have been,” said Seldon. He handed the man a reference tile bearing his \\n\\n',\n",

It’s important.”\\n\\n“Well, I’m not sure, sir.”\\n\\n“Do it,” said Seldon. “If you get into any sort of trouble over it, I’ll straighten it out. And \\nmeanwhile, gentlemen, do you mind if I study the Galaxy simulation for a moment? It’s \\nbeen a long time since I’ve looked at one.”\\n\\nThey nodded mutely, apparently abashed at being in the presence of a former First \\nMinister. One by one the men stepped back and allowed Seldon access to the \\nGalactograph controls.\\n\\nSeldon’s finger reached out to the controls and the red that had marked off the Province \\nof Anacreon vanished. The Galaxy was unmarked, a glowing pinwheel of mist \\nbrightening into the spherical glow at the center, behind which was the Galactic black \\nhole.\\n\\nIndividual stars could not be made out, of course, unless the view were magnified, but \\nthen only one portion or another of the Galaxy would be shown on the screen and \\nSeldon wanted to see the whole thing --to get a look at the Empire that was vanishing.\\n\\nHe pushed a contact and a series of yellow dots appeared on the Galactic image. They \\nrepresented the habitable planets--twenty-five million of them. They could be \\ndistinguished as individual dots in the thin fog that represented the outskirts of the \\nGalaxy, but they were more and more thickly placed as one moved in toward the center. \\nThere was a belt of what seemed solid yellow (but which would separate into individual \\ndots under magnification) around the central glow. The central glow itself remained \\nwhite and unmarked, of course. No habitable planets could exist in the midst of the \\nturbulent energies of the core.\\n\\nDespite the great density of yellow, not one star in ten thousand, Seldon knew, had a \\nhabitable planet circling it. This was true, despite the planet-molding and terraforming \\ncapacities of humanity. Not all the molding in the Galaxy could make most of the worlds \\ninto anything a human being could walk on in comfort and without the protection of a \\nspacesuit.\\n\\nSeldon closed another contact. The yellow dots disappeared, but one tiny region glowed \\n\\n',\n",
              " 'blue: Trantor and the various worlds directly dependent on it. As close as it could be to \\nthe central core and yet remaining insulated from its deadliness, it was commonly \\nviewed as being located at the “center of the Galaxy,” which it wasn’t--not truly. As \\nusual, one had to be impressed by the smallness of the world of Trantor, a tiny place in \\nthe vast realm of the Galaxy, but within it was squeezed the largest concentration of \\nwealth, culture, and governmental authority that humanity had ever seen.\\n\\nAnd even that was doomed to destruction.\\n\\nIt was almost as though the men could read his mind or perhaps they interpreted the sad \\nexpression on his face.\\n\\nBaldy asked softly, “Is the Empire really going to be destroyed?”\\n\\nSeldon replied, softer still, “It might. It might. Anything might happen.”\\n\\nHe rose, smiled at the men, and left, but in his thoughts he screamed: It will! It will!\\n\\n  \\n\\n 2\\n\\n  \\n\\n      Seldon sighed as he climbed into one of the skitters that were ranked side by side in \\nthe large alcove. There had been a time, just a few years ago, when he had gloried in \\nwalking briskly along the interminable corridors of the Library, telling himself that even \\nthough he was past sixty he could manage it.\\n\\nBut now, at seventy, his legs gave way all too quickly and he had to take a skitter. \\nYounger men took them all the time because skitters saved them trouble, but Seldon did \\nit because he had to--and that made all the difference.\\n\\nAfter Seldon punched in the destination, he closed a contact and the skitter lifted a \\nfraction of an inch above the floor. Off it went at a rather casual pace, very smoothly, \\nvery silently, and Seldon leaned back and watched the corridor walls, the other skitters, \\nthe occasional walkers.\\n\\nHe passed a number of Librarians and, even after all these years, he still smiled when he \\nsaw them. They were the oldest Guild in the Empire, the one with the most revered \\ntraditions, and they clung to ways that were more appropriate centuries before--maybe \\nmillennia before.\\n\\n',\n",
              " 'Their garments were silky and off-white and were loose enough to be almost gownlike, \\ncoming together at the neck and billowing out from there.\\n\\nTrantor, like all the worlds, oscillated, where the males were concerned, between facial \\nhair and smoothness. The people of Trantor itself --or at least most of its sectors--were \\nsmooth-shaven and had been smooth-shaven for as far back as he knew--excepting such \\nanomalies as the mustaches worn by Dahlites, such as his own foster son, Raych.\\n\\nThe Librarians, however, clung to thebeards of long ago. Every Librarian had a rather \\nshort neatly cultivated beard running from ear to ear but leaving bare the upper lip. That \\nalone was enough to mark them for what they were and to make the smooth-shaven \\nSeldon feel a little uncomfortable when surrounded by a crowd of them.\\n\\nActually the most characteristic thing of all was the cap each wore (perhaps even when \\nasleep, Seldon thought). Square, it was made of a velvety material, in four parts that \\ncame together with a button at the top. The caps came in an endless variety of colors and \\napparently each color had significance. If you were familiar with Librarian lore, you \\ncould tell a particular Librarian’s length of service, area of expertise, grades of \\naccomplishment, and so on. They helped fix a pecking order. Every Librarian could, by \\na glance at another’s hat, tell whether to be respectful (and to what degree) or \\noverbearing (and to what degree).\\n\\nThe Galactic Library was the largest single structure on Trantor (possibly in the Galaxy), \\nmuch larger than even the Imperial Palace, and it had once gleamed and glittered, as \\nthough boasting of its size and magnificence. However, like the Empire itself, it had \\nfaded and withered. It was like an old dowager still wearing the jewels of her youth but \\nupon a body that was wrinkled and wattled.\\n\\nThe skitter stopped in front of the ornate doorway of the Chief Librarian’s office and \\nSeldon climbed out.\\n\\nLas Zenow smiled as he greeted Seldon. “Welcome, my friend,” he said in his high-\\npitched voice. (Seldon wondered if he had ever sung tenor in his younger days but had \\nnever dared to ask. The Chief Librarian was a compound of dignity always and the \\nquestion might have seemed offensive.)\\n\\n“Greetings,” said Seldon. Zenow had a gray beard, rather more than halfway to white, \\nand he wore a pure white hat. Seldon understoodthat without any explanation. It was a \\ncase of reverse ostentation. The total absence of color represented the highest peak of \\nposition.\\n\\n',\n",
              " 'Zenow rubbed his hands with what seemed to be an inner glee. “I’ve called you in, Hari, \\nbecause I’ve got good news for you. --We’ve found it!\\n\\n“By ‘it,’ Las, you mean--”\\n\\n“A suitable world. You wanted one far out. I think we’ve located the ideal one.” His \\nsmile broadened. “You just leave it to the Library. Hari. We can find anything.”\\n\\n“I have no doubt, Las. Tell me about this world.”\\n\\n“Well, let me show you its location first.” A section of the wall slid aside, the lights in \\nthe room dimmed, and the Galaxy appeared in three-dimensional form, turning slowly. \\nAgain, red lines marked off the Province of Anacreon, so that Seldon could almost swear \\nthat the episode with the three men had been a rehearsal for this.\\n\\nAnd then a brilliant blue dot appeared at the far end of the province. “There it is,” said \\nZenow. “It’s an ideal world. Sizable, well-watered, good oxygen atmosphere, vegetation, \\nof course. A great deal of sea life. It’s there just for the taking. No planet-molding or \\nterraforming required --or, at least, none that cannot be done while it is actually \\noccupied.”\\n\\nSeldon said, “Is it an unoccupied world, Las?”\\n\\n“Absolutely unoccupied. No one on it.”\\n\\n“But why--if it’s so suitable? I presume that, if you have all the details about it, it must \\nhave been explored. Why wasn’t it colonized?”\\n\\n“It was explored, but only by unmanned probes. And there was no colonization--\\npresumably because it was so far from everything. The planet revolves around a star that \\nis farther from the central black hole than that of any inhabited planet--farther by far. \\nToo far, I suppose, for prospective colonists, but I think not too far for you. You said, \\n‘The farther, the better.’ “\\n\\n“Yes,” said Seldon, nodding. “I still say so. Does it have a name or is there just a letter-\\nnumber combination?”\\n\\n“Believe it or not, it has a name. Those who sent out the probes named it Terminus, an \\narchaic word meaning ‘the end of the line.’ Which it would seem to be.”\\n\\nSeldon said, “Is the world part of the territory of the Province of Anacreon?”\\n\\n',\n",
              " '“Not really,” said Zenow. “If you’ll study the red line and the red shading, you will see \\nthat the blue dot of Terminus lies slightly outside it --fifty light-years outside it, in fact. \\nTerminus belongs to nobody; it’s not even part of the Empire, as a matter of fact.”\\n\\n“You’re right, then, Las. It does seem like the ideal world I’ve been looking for.”\\n\\n“Of course,” said Zenow thoughtfully, “once you occupy Terminus, I imagine the \\nGovernor of Anacreon will claim it as being under his jurisdiction.”\\n\\n“That’s possible,” said Seldon, “but we’ll have to deal with that when the matter comes \\nup.”\\n\\nZenow rubbed his hands again. “What a glorious conception. Setting up a huge project \\non a brand-new world, far away and entirely isolated, so that year by year and decade by \\ndecade a huge Encyclopedia of all human knowledge can be put together. An epitome of \\nwhat is present in this Library. If I were only younger, I would love to join the \\nexpedition.”\\n\\nSeldon said sadly, “You’re almost twenty years younger than I am.” (Almost everyone is \\nfar younger than I am, he thought, even more sadly.)\\n\\nZenow said, “Ah yes, I heard that you just passed your seventieth birthday. I hope you \\nenjoyed it and celebrated appropriately.”\\n\\nSeldon stirred. “I don’t celebrate my birthdays.”\\n\\n“Oh, but you did. I remember the famous story of your sixtieth birthday.”\\n\\nSeldon felt the pain, as deeply as though the dearest loss in all the world had taken place \\nthe day before. “Please don’t talk about it,” he said.\\n\\nAbashed, Zenow said, “I’m sorry. We’ll talk about something else. If, indeed, Terminus \\nis the world you want, I imagine that your work on the preliminaries to the Encyclopedia \\nProject will be redoubled. As you know, the Library will be glad to help you in all \\nrespects.”\\n\\n“I’m aware of it, Las, and I am endlessly grateful. We will, indeed, keep working.”\\n\\nHe rose, not yet able to smile after the sharp pang induced by the reference to his \\nbirthday celebration of ten years back. He said, “So I must go to continue my labors.”\\n\\nAnd as he left, he felt, as always, a pang of conscience over the deceit he was practicing. \\n\\n',\n",
              " 'Las Zenow did not have the slightest idea of Seldon’s true intentions.\\n\\n  \\n\\n 3\\n\\n  \\n\\n      Hari Seldon surveyed the comfortable suite that had been his personal office at the \\nGalactic Library these past few years. It, like the rest of the Library, had a vague air of \\ndecay about it, a kind of weariness--something that had been too long in one place. And \\nyet Seldon knew it might remain here, in the same place, for centuries more--with \\njudicious rebuildings--for millennia even.\\n\\nHow did he come to be here?\\n\\nOver and over again, he felt the past in his mind, ran his mental tendrils along the line of \\ndevelopment of his life. It was part of growing older, no doubt. There was so much more \\nin the past, so much less in the future, that the mind turned away from the looming \\nshadow ahead to contemplate the safety of what had gone before.\\n\\nIn his case, though, there was that change. For over thirty years psychohistory had \\ndeveloped in what might almost be considered a straight line--progress creepingly slow \\nbut moving straight ahead. Then six years ago there had been a right-angled turn--totally \\nunexpected.\\n\\nAnd Seldon know exactly how it had happened, how a concatenation of events came \\ntogether to make it possible.\\n\\nIt was Wanda, of course, Seldon’s granddaughter. Hari closed his eyes and settled into \\nhis chair to review the events of six years before.\\n\\nTwelve-year-old Wanda was bereft. Her mother, Manella, had had another child, another \\nlittle girl, Bellis, and for a time the new baby was a total preoccupation.\\n\\nHer father, Raych, having finished his book on his home sector of Dahl, found it to be a \\nminor success and himself a minor celebrity. He was called upon to talk on the subject, \\nsomething he accepted with alacrity, for he was fiercely absorbed in the subject and, as \\nhe said to Hari with a grin, “When I talk about Dahl, I don’t have to hide my Dahlite \\naccent. In fact, the public expects it of me.”\\n\\nThe net result, though, was that he was away from home a considerable amount of time \\n\\n',\n",
              " 'and when he wasn’t, it was the baby he wanted to see.\\n\\nAs for Dors--Dors was gone--and to Hari Seldon that wound was ever-fresh, ever-\\npainful. And he had reacted to it in an unfortunate manner. It had been Wanda’s dream \\nthat had set in motion the current of events that had ended with the loss of Dors.\\n\\nWanda had had nothing to do with it--Seldon knew that very well. And yet he found \\nhimself shrinking from her, so that he also failed her in the crisis brought about by the \\nbirth of the new baby.\\n\\nAnd Wanda wandered disconsolately to the one person who always seemed glad to see \\nher, the one person she could always count on. That WAS Yugo Amaryl, second only to \\nHari Seldon in the development of psychohistory and first in his absolute round-the-\\nclock devotion to it. Hari had had Dors and Raych, but psychohistory was Yugo’s life; he \\nhad no wife and children. Yet whenever Wanda came into his presence, something \\nwithin him recognized her as a child and he dimly felt--for just that moment--a sense of \\nloss that seemed to be assuaged only by showing the child affection. To be sure, he \\ntended to treat her as a rather undersized adult, but Wanda seemed to like that.\\n\\nIt was six years ago that she had wandered into Yugo’s office. Yugo looked up at her \\nwith his owlish reconstituted eyes and, as usual, took a moment or two to recognize her.\\n\\nThen he said, “Why, it’s my dear friend Wanda. --but why do you look so sad? Surely an \\nattractive young woman like you should never feel sad.”\\n\\nAnd Wanda, her lower lip trembling, said, “Nobody loves me.”\\n\\n“Oh come, that’s not true.”\\n\\n“I love you, Wanda.”\\n\\n“They just love that new baby. They don’t care about me anymore.”\\n\\n“Well, you’re the only one then, Uncle Yugo.” And even though she could no longer \\ncrawl onto his lap as she had when she was younger, she cradled her head on his \\nshoulder and wept.\\n\\nAmaryl, totally unaware of what he should do, could only hug the girl and say, “Don’t \\ncry. Don’t cry.” And out of sheer sympathy and because he had so little in his own life to \\nweep about, he found that tears were trickling down his own cheeks as well.\\n\\nAnd then he said with sudden energy, “Wanda, would you like to see something pretty?”\\n\\n',\n",
              " '“What?” sniffled Wanda.\\n\\n“No. What is it?”\\n\\nAmaryl knew only one thing in life and the Universe that was pretty. He said, “Did you \\never see the Prime Radiant?”\\n\\n“It’s what your grandfather and I use to do our work. See? It’s right here.”\\n\\nHe pointed to the black cube on his desk and Wanda looked at it woefully. “That’s not \\npretty,” she said.\\n\\n“Not now,” agreed Amaryl. “But watch when I turn it on.”\\n\\nHe did so. The room darkened and filled with dots of light and flashes of different \\ncolors. “See? Now we can magnify it so all the dots become mathematical symbols.”\\n\\nAnd so they did. There seemed a rush of material toward them and there, in the air, were \\nsigns of all sorts, letters, numbers, arrows, and shapes that Wanda had never seen before.\\n\\n“Isn’t it pretty?” asked Amaryl.\\n\\n“Yes, it is,” said Wanda, staring carefully at the equations that (she didn’t know) \\nrepresented possible futures. “I don’t like that part, though. I think it’s wrong.” She \\npointed at a colorful equation to her left.\\n\\n“Wrong? Why do you say it’s wrong” said Amaryl, frowning.\\n\\n“Because it’s not . . . pretty. I’d do it a different way.”\\n\\nAmaryl cleared his throat. “Well, I’ll try to fix it up.” And he moved closer to the \\nequation in question, staring at it in his owlish fashion.\\n\\nWanda said, “Thank you very much, Uncle Yugo, for showing me your pretty lights. \\nMaybe someday I’ll understand what they mean.”\\n\\n“That’s all right,” said Amaryl. “I hope you feel better.”\\n\\n“A little, thanks,” and, after flashing the briefest of smiles, she left the room.\\n\\nAmaryl stood there, feeling a trifle hurt.

He was only fifty-three, but he looked \\nmuch older, bent, worn down to almost transparency. When forced, he had undergone \\ndoctors’ examinations and the doctors had all recommended that he leave his work for a \\nperiod of time (some said permanently) andrest .

The programming was inexact and that area, the \\nprecise area to which Wanda pointed, was no good. And, really, it wasn’t pretty.”\\n\\nSeldon sat up rather stiffly, frowning. “Let me get this straight, Yugo. She pointed to \\nsomething at random, said it was no good, and she wasright ?”\\n\\n“Yes. She pointed, but it wasn’t at random; she was very deliberate.”\\n\\n“But that’s impossible.”\\n\\n“But it happened. I was there.”\\n\\n“I’m not saying it didn’t happen. I’m saying it was just a wild coincidence.”\\n\\n“Is it? Do you think, with all your knowledge of psychohistory, you could take one \\nglance at a new set of equations and tell me that one portion is no good?”\\n\\nSeldon said, “Well then, Yugo, how did you come to expand that particular portion of the \\nequations? What made you choosethat piece for magnification?”\\n\\nAmaryl shrugged. “Thatwas coincidence--if you like. I just fiddled with the controls.”\\n\\n“That couldn’t be coincidence,” muttered Seldon. For a few moments he was lost in \\nthought, then he asked the question that pushed forward the psychohistorical revolution \\n\\n',\n",

Did you \\nhave any reason to believe there was something wrong with them?”\\n\\nAmaryl fiddled with the sash of his unisuit and seemed embarrassed. “Yes, I think I did. \\nYou see--”\\n\\n“Youthink you did?”\\n\\n“I know I did. I seemed to recall when I was setting it up--it’s a new section, you know--\\nmy fingers seemed to glitch on the programmer. It looked all right then, but I guess I \\nkept worrying about it inside. I remember thinking it looked wrong, but I had other \\nthings to do and I just let it go. But then when Wanda happened to point to precisely the \\narea I had been concerned about, I decided to check up on her--otherwise I would just \\nhave let it go as a childish statement.”\\n\\n“And you turned on that very fragment of the equations to show Wanda. As though it \\nwere haunting your unconscious mind.”\\n\\nAmaryl shrugged. “Who knows?”\\n\\n“And just before that, you were very close together, hugging, both crying.”\\n\\nAmaryl shrugged again, looking even more embarrassed.\\n\\nSeldon said, “I think I know what happened, Yugo. Wanda read your mind.”\\n\\nAmaryl jumped, as though he had been bitten. “That’s impossible!”\\n\\nSlowly Seldon said, “I once knew someone who had unusual mental powers of that \\nsort”--and he thought sadly of Eto Demerzel or, as Seldon had secretly known him, \\nDaneel-- “only he was somewhat more than human. But his ability to read minds, to \\nsense other people’s thoughts, to persuade people to act in a certain way--that was \\namental ability. I think, somehow, that perhaps Wanda has that ability as well.”\\n\\n“I can’t believe it,” said Amaryl stubbornly.\\n\\n“I can,” said Seldon “but I don’t know what to do about it.” Dimly lie felt the rumblings \\nof a revolution in psychohistorical research--but only dimly.\\n\\n  \\n\\n',\n",

But how are you?”\\n\\nRaych was forty-four now and his hair was beginning to show a bit of gray, but his \\nmustache remained thick and dark and very Dahlite in appearance. Seldon wondered if \\nhe touched it up with dye, but it would have been the wrong thing to ask.\\n\\nSeldon said, “Are you through with your lecturing for a while?”\\n\\n“For a while. Not for long. And I’m glad to be home and see the baby and Manella and \\nWanda--and you, Dad.”\\n\\n“Thank you. But I have news for you, Raych. No more lecturing. I’m going to need you \\nhere.”\\n\\nRaych frowned. “What for?” On two different occasions he had been sent to carry out \\ndelicate missions, but those were back during the days of the Joranumite menace. As far \\nas he knew, things were quiet now, especially with the overthrow of the junta and the \\nreestablishment of a pale Emperor.\\n\\n“It’s Wanda,” said Seldon.\\n\\n“Wanda? What’s wrong with Wanda?”\\n\\n“Nothing’s wrong with her, but we’re going to have to work out a complete genome for \\nher--and for you and Manella as well--and eventually for the new baby.”\\n\\n“For Bellis, too? What’s going on?”\\n\\nSeldon hesitated. “Raych, you know that your mother and I always thought there was \\nsomething lovable about you, something that inspired affection and trust.”\\n\\n“I know you thought so. You said so often enough when you were trying to get me to do \\nsomething difficult. But I’ll be honest with you. I never felt it.”\\n\\n“No, you won over me and . . . and Dors.” (He had such trouble saying the name, even \\n\\n',\n",
              " 'though four years had passed since her destruction.) “You won over Rashelle of Wye. \\nYou won over Jo-Jo Joranum. You won over Manella. How do you account for all that?”\\n\\n“Intelligence and charm,” said Raych, grinning.\\n\\n“Have you thought you might have been in touch with their--our--minds?”\\n\\n“No, I’ve never thought that. And now that you mention it, I think it’s ridiculous. --With \\nall due respect, Dad, of course.”\\n\\n“What if I told you that Wanda seems to have read Yugo’s mind during a moment of \\ncrisis?”\\n\\n“Coincidence or imagination, I should say.”\\n\\n“Raych, I knew someone once who could handle people’s minds as easily as you and I \\nhandle conversation.”\\n\\n“Who was that?”\\n\\n“I can’t speak of him. Take my word for it, though.”\\n\\n“Well--” said Raych dubiously.\\n\\n“I’ve been at the Galactic Library, checking on such matters. There is a curious story, \\nabout twenty thousand years old and therefore back to the misty origins of hyperspatial \\ntravel. It’s about a young woman, not much more than Wanda’s age, who could \\ncommunicate with an entire planet that circled a sun called Nemesis.”\\n\\n“Surely a fairytale.”\\n\\n“Surely. And incomplete, at that. But the similarity with Wanda is astonishing.”\\n\\nRaych said, “Dad, what are you planning?”\\n\\n“I’m not sure, Raych. I need to know the genome and I have to find others like Wanda. I \\nhave a notion that youngsters are born--not often but occasionally--with such mental \\nabilities, but that, in general, it merely gets them in trouble and they learn to mask it. \\nAnd as they grow tip, their ability, their talent, is buried deep within their minds--sort of \\nan unconscious act of self-preservation. Surely in the Empire or even just among \\nTrantor’s forty billion, there must be more of that sort, like Wanda, and if I know the \\ngenome I want, I can test those I think may be so.”\\n\\n',\n",
              " '“And what would you do with them if you found them, Dad?”\\n\\n“I have the notion that they are what I need for the further development of \\npsychohistory.”\\n\\nRaych said, “And Wanda is the first of the type you know about and you intend to make \\na psychohistorian out of her?”\\n\\n“Like Yugo. --Dad, no!”\\n\\n“Perhaps.”\\n\\n“Why no?”\\n\\n“Because I want her to grow up like a normal girl and become a normal woman. I will \\nnot have you sitting her before the Prime Radiant and make her into a living monument \\nto psychohistorical mathematics.”\\n\\nSeldon said, “It may not come to that, Raych, but we must have her genome. You know \\nthat for thousands of years there have been suggestions that every human being have his \\ngenome on file. It’s only the expense that’s kept it from becoming standard practice; no \\none doubts the usefulness of it. Surely you see the advantages. If nothing else, we will \\nknow Wanda’s tendencies toward a variety of physiological disorders. If we had ever \\nhad Yugo’s genome, I am certain he would not now be dying. Surely we can go that far.”\\n\\n“Well, maybe, Dad, but no further. I’m willing to bet that Manella is going to be a lot \\nfirmer on this than I am.”\\n\\nSeldon said, “Very well. But remember, no more lecture tours. I need you at home.”\\n\\n“We’ll see,” Raych said and left.\\n\\nSeldon sat there in a quandary. Eto Demerzel, the one person he knew who could handle \\nminds, would have known what to do. Dors, with her nonhuman knowledge, might have \\nknown what to do.\\n\\nFor himself, he had a dim vision of a new psychohistory--but nothing more than that.\\n\\n  \\n\\n 6\\n\\n',\n",
              " '  \\n\\n      It was not an easy task to obtain a complete genome of Wanda. To begin with, the \\nnumber of biophysicists equipped to handle the genome was small and those that existed \\nwere always busy.\\n\\nNor was it possible for Seldon to discuss his needs openly, in order to interest the \\nbiophysicists. It was absolutely essential, Seldon felt, that the true reason for his interest \\nin Wanda’s mental powers be kept secret from all the Galaxy.\\n\\nAnd if another difficulty was needed, it was the fact that the process was infernally \\nexpensive.\\n\\nSeldon shook his head and said to Mian Endelecki, the biophysicist he was now \\nconsulting, “Why so expensive, Dr. Endelecki? I am not an expert in the field, but it is \\nmy distinct understanding that the process is completely computerized and that, once \\nyou have a scraping of skin cells, the genome can be completely built and analyzed in a \\nmatter of days.”\\n\\n“That’s true. But having a deoxyribonucleic acid molecule stretching out for billions of \\nnucleotides, with every puring and pyrimidine in its place, is the least of it; the very least \\nof it, Professor Seldon. There is then the matter of studying each one and comparing it to \\nsome standard.\\n\\n“Now, consider, in the first place, that although we have records of complete genomes, \\nthey represent a vanishingly small fraction of the number of genomes that exist, so that \\nwe don’t really know how standard they are.”\\n\\nSeldon asked, “Why so few?”\\n\\n“A number of reasons. The expense, for one thing. Few people are willing to spend the \\ncredits on it unless they have strong reason to think there is something wrong with their \\ngenome. And if they have no strong reason, they are reluctant to undergo analysis for \\nfear theywill find something wrong. Now, then, are you sure you want your \\ngranddaughter genomed?”\\n\\n“Yes, I do. It is terribly important.”\\n\\n“Why? Does she show signs of a metabolic anomaly?”\\n\\n“No, she doesn’t. Rather the reverse--if I knew the antonym of ‘anomaly.’ I consider her \\n\\n',\n",
              " 'a most unusual person and I want to know just what it is that makes her unusual.”\\n\\n“Unusual in what way?”\\n\\n“Mentally, but it’s impossible for me to go into details, since I don’t entirely understand \\nit. Maybe I will, once she is genomed.”\\n\\n“How old is she?”\\n\\n“Twelve. She’ll soon be thirteen.”\\n\\n“In that case, I’ll need permission from her parents.”\\n\\nSeldon cleared his throat. “That may be difficult to get. I’m her grandfather. Wouldn’t \\nmy permission be enough?”\\n\\n“For me, certainly. But, you know, we’re talking about the law. I don’t wish to lose my \\nlicense to practice.”\\n\\nIt was necessary for Seldon to approach Raych again. This, too, was difficult, as he \\nprotested once more that he and his wife, Manella, wanted Wanda to live a normal life of \\na normal girl. What if her genome did turn out to be abnormal? Would she be whisked \\naway to be prodded and probed like a laboratory specimen? Would Hari, in his fanatical \\ndevotion to his Psychohistory Project, press Wanda into a life of all work and no play, \\nshutting her off from other young people her age? But Seldon was insistent.\\n\\n“Trust me, Raych. I would never do anything to harm Wanda. But this must be done. I \\nneed to know Wanda’s genome. If it is as I suspect it is, we may be on the verge of \\naltering the course of psychohistory, of the future of the Galaxy itself!”\\n\\nAnd so Raych was persuaded and somehow he obtained Manella’s consent, as well. And \\ntogether, the three adults took Wanda to Dr. Endelecki’s office.\\n\\nMian Endelecki greeted them at the door. Her hair was a shining white, but her face \\nshowed no sign of age.\\n\\nShe looked at the girl, who walked in with a look of curiosity on her face but with no \\nsigns of apprehension or fear. She then turned her gaze to the three adults who had \\naccompanied Wanda.\\n\\nDr. Endelecki said with a smile, “Mother, father, and grandfather--am I right?”\\n\\n',\n",
              " 'Seldon answered, “Absolutely right.”\\n\\nRaych looked hang-dog and Manella, her face a little swollen and her eyes a little red, \\nlooked tired.\\n\\n“Wanda,” began the doctor. “That is your name, isn’t it?”\\n\\n“Yes, ma’am,” said Wanda in her clear voice.\\n\\n“I’m going to tell you exactly what I’m going to do with you. You’re right-handed, I \\nsuppose.”\\n\\n“Yes, ma’am.”\\n\\n“Very well, then, I’ll spray a little patch on your left forearm with an anesthetic. It will \\njust feel like a cool wind. Nothing else. I’ll then scrape a little skin from you just a tiny \\nbit. There’ll be no pain, no blood, no mark afterward. When I’m done, I’ll spray a little \\ndisinfectant on it. The whole thing will take just a few minutes. Does that sound all right \\nto you?”\\n\\n“Sure,” said Wanda, as she held out her arm.\\n\\nWhen it was over, Dr. Endelecki said, “I’ll put the scraping under the microscope, \\nchoose a decent cell, and put my computerized gene analyzer to work. It will mark off \\nevery last nucleotide, but there are billions of them. It will probably take the better part \\nof a day. It’s all automatic, of course, so I won’t be sitting here watching it and there’s no \\npoint in your doing so, either.\\n\\n“Once the genome is prepared, it will take an even longer time to analyze it. If you want \\na complete job, it may take a couple of weeks. That is why it’s so expensive a procedure. \\nThe work is hard and long. I’ll call you in when I have it.” She turned away, as if she \\nhad dismissed the family, and busied herself with the gleaming apparatus on the table in \\nfront of her.\\n\\nSeldon said, “If you come across anything unusual, will you get in touch with me \\ninstantly? I mean, don’t wait for a complete analysis if you find something in the first \\nhour. Don’t make me wait.”\\n\\n“The chances of finding anything in the first hour are very slim, but I promise you, \\nProfessor Seldon that I will be in touch with you at once if it seems necessary.”\\n\\nManella snatched Wanda’s arm and led her off triumphantly. Raych followed, feet \\n\\n',\n",
              " 'dragging. Seldon lingered and said, “This is more important than you know, Dr. \\nEndelecki.”\\n\\nDr. Endelecki nodded as she said, “Whatever the reason, Professor, I’ll do my best.”\\n\\nSeldon left, his lips pressed tightly together. Why he had thought that somehow the \\ngenome would be worked out in five minutes and that a glance at it in another five \\nminutes would give him an answer, he did not know. Now he would have to wait for \\nweeks, without knowing what would be found.\\n\\nHe ground his teeth. Would his newest brainchild, the Second Foundation, ever be \\nestablished or was it an illusion that would remain always just out of reach?\\n\\n  \\n\\n 7\\n\\n  \\n\\n      Hari Seldon walked into Dr. Endelecki’s office, a nervous smile on his face.\\n\\nHe said, “You said a couple of weeks, Doctor. It’s been over a month mow.”\\n\\nDr. Endelecki nodded. “I’m sorry, Professor Seldon but you wanted everything exact \\nand that is what I have tried to do.”\\n\\n“Well?” The look of anxiety on Seldon’s face did not disappear. What did you find?”\\n\\n“A hundred or so defective genes.”\\n\\n“What! Defective genes. Are you serious, Doctor?”\\n\\n“Quite serious. Why not? There are no genomes without at least a hundred defective \\ngenes; usually there are considerably more. It’s not as bad as it sounds, you know.”\\n\\n“No, I don’t know. You’re the expert, Doctor, not I.”\\n\\nDr. Endelecki sighed and stirred in her chair. “You don’t know anything about genetics, \\ndo you, Professor?”\\n\\n“No, I don’t. A man can’t know everything.”\\n\\n',\n",
              " '“You’re perfectly right. I know nothing about this--what do you call it?--this \\npsychohistory of yours.”\\n\\nDr. Endelecki shrugged, then continued. “If you wanted to explain anything about it, you \\nwould be forced to start from the beginning and I would probably not understand it even \\nso. “Now, as to genetics--”\\n\\n“Well?”\\n\\n“An imperfect gene usually means nothing. There are imperfect genes--so imperfect and \\nso crucial that they produce terrible disorders. These are very rare, though. Most \\nimperfect genes simply don’t work with absolute accuracy. They’re like wheels that are \\nslightly out of balance. A vehicle will move along, trembling a bit, but it will move \\nalong.”\\n\\n“Is that what Wanda has?”\\n\\n“Yes. More or less. After all, if all genes were perfect, we would all look precisely the \\nsame, we would all behave precisely the same. It’s the difference in genes that makes for \\ndifferent people.”\\n\\n“But won’t it get worse as we grow older?”\\n\\n“Yes. We all get worse as we grow older. I noticed you limping when you came in. Why \\nis that?”\\n\\n“A touch of sciatica,” muttered Seldon.\\n\\n“Did you have it all your life?”\\n\\n“Of course not.”\\n\\n“Well, some of your genes have gotten worse with time and now you limp.”\\n\\n“And what will happen to Wanda with time?”\\n\\n“I don’t know. I can’t predict the future, Professor; I believe that is your province. \\nHowever, if I were to hazard a guess, I would say that nothing unusual will happen to \\nWanda--at least, genetically--except the gathering of old age.”\\n\\nSeldon said, “Are you sure?”\\n\\n',\n",
              " '“You have to take my word for it. You wanted to find out about Wanda’s genome and \\nyou ran the risk of discovering things perhaps it is better not to know. But I tell you that, \\nin my opinion, I can see nothing terrible happening to her.”\\n\\n“The imperfect genes--should we fix them? Can we fix them?”\\n\\n“No. In the first place, it would be very expensive. Secondly, the chances are that they \\nwould not stay fixed. And finally, people are against it.\\n\\n“But why?”\\n\\n“Because they’re against science in general. You should know this as well as anyone, \\nProfessor. I’m afraid the situation is such, especially since Cleon’s death, that mysticism \\nhas been gaining ground. People don’t believe in fixing genes scientifically. They would \\nrather cure things by the laying on of hands or by mumbo-jumbo of some sort or other. \\nFrankly it is extremely difficult for me to continue with my job. Very little funding is \\ncoming in.”\\n\\nSeldon nodded. “Actually I understand this situation all too well. Psychohistory explains \\nit, but I honestly didn’t think the situation was growing so bad so rapidly. I’ve been too \\ninvolved in my own work to see the difficulties all around me.” He sighed. “I’ve been \\nwatching the Galactic Empire slowly fall apart for over thirty years now--and now that \\nit’s beginning to collapse much more rapidly, I don’t see how we can stop it in time.”\\n\\n“Are you trying to?” Dr. Endelecki seemed amused.\\n\\n“Yes, I am.”\\n\\n“Why not?”\\n\\n“Lots of luck. --About your sciatica. You know, fifty years ago it could have been cured. \\nNot now, though.”\\n\\n“Well, the devices used for it are gone; the people who could have handled them are \\nworking on other things. Medicine is declining.”\\n\\n“Along with everything else,” mused Seldon. “--but let’s get back to Wanda. I feel she is \\na most unusual young woman with a brain that is different from most. What do her \\ngenes tell you about her brain?”\\n\\nDr. Endelecki leaned back in her chair. “Professor Seldon do you know just how many \\ngenes are involved in brain function?”\\n\\n',\n",
              " '“No.\\n\\n“Thousands?”\\n\\n“I’ll remind you that, of all the aspects of the human body, the brain Junction is the most \\nintricate. In fact, as far as we know, there is nothing m the Universe as intricate as the \\nhuman brain. So you won’t be surprised when I tell you that there are thousands of \\ngenes that each play a i0ale in brain function.”\\n\\n“Exactly. And it is impossible to go through those genes and see anything specifically \\nunusual. I will take your word for it, as far as Wanda is concerned. She is an unusual girl \\nwith an unusual brain, but I see nothing in her genes that can tell me anything about that \\nbrain--except, of course, that it is normal.”\\n\\n“Could you find other people whose genes for mental functioning are like Wanda’s, that \\nhave the same brain pattern?”\\n\\n“I doubt it very much. Even if another brain were much like hers, there would still be \\nenormous differences in the genes. No use looking for similarities. --Tell me, Professor, \\njust what is it about Wanda that makes you think her brain is so unusual?”\\n\\nSeldon shook his head. “I’m sorry. It’s not something I can discuss.”\\n\\n“In that case, I amcertain that I can find out nothing for you. How did you discover that \\nthere was something unusual about her brain--this thing you can’t discuss?”\\n\\n“Accident,” muttered Seldon. “Sheer accident.”\\n\\n“In that case, you’re going to have to find other brains like hers--also by accident. \\nNothing else can be done.”\\n\\nSilence settled over both of them. Finally Seldon said, “Is there anything else you can \\ntell me?”\\n\\n“I’m afraid not. Except that I’ll send you my bill.”\\n\\nSeldon rose with an effort. His sciatica hurt him badly. “Well then, thank you, Doctor. \\nSend the bill and I’ll pay it.”\\n\\nHari Seldon left the doctor’s office, wondering just what he would do next.\\n\\n',\n",
              " '  \\n\\n 8\\n\\n  \\n\\n      Like any intellectual, Hari Seldon had made use of the Galactic Library freely. For \\nthe most part, it had been done long-distance through computer, but occasionally he had \\nvisited it, more to get away from the pressures of the Psychohistory Project than for any \\nother purpose. And, for the past couple of years, since he had first formulated his plan to \\nfind others like Wanda, he had kept a private office there, so he could have ready access \\nto any of the Library’s vast collection of data. He had even rented a small apartment in \\nan adjacent sector under the dome so that he would be able to walk to the Library when \\nhis ever-increasing research there prevented him from returning to the Streeling Sector.\\n\\nNow, however, his plan had taken on new dimensions and he wanted to meet Las \\nZenow. It was the first time he had ever met him face-to-face.\\n\\nIt was not easy to arrange a personal interview with the Chief Librarian of the Galactic \\nLibrary. His own perception of the nature and value of his office was high and it was \\nfrequently said that when the Emperor wished to consult the Chief Librarian, even he \\nhad to visit the Library himself and wait his turn.\\n\\nSeldon however, had no trouble. Zenow knew him well, though he had never seen Hari \\nSeldon in person. “An honor, First Minister,” he said in greeting.\\n\\nSeldon smiled. “I trust you know that I have not held that post in sixteen years.”\\n\\n“The honor of the title is still yours. Besides, sir, you were also instrumental in ridding \\nus of the brutal rule of the junta. The junta, on a number of occasions, violated the \\nsacred rule of the neutrality of the Library.”\\n\\n(Ah, thought Seldonthat accounts for the readiness with which he saw me.)\\n\\n“Merely rumor,” he said aloud.\\n\\n“And now, tell me,” said Zenow, who could not resist a quick look at the time band on \\nhis wrist, “what can I do for you?”\\n\\n“Chief Librarian,” began Seldon “I have not come to ask anything easy of you. What I \\nwant is more space at the Library. I want permission to bring in a number of my \\nassociates. I want permission to undertake a long and elaborate program of the greatest \\n\\n',\n",
              " 'importance.”\\n\\nLas Zenow’s face drew into an expression of distress. “You ask a great deal. Can you \\nexplain the importance of all this?”\\n\\n“Yes. The Empire is in the process of disintegration.”\\n\\nThere was a long pause. Then Zenow said, “I have heard of your research into \\npsychohistory. I have been told that your new science bears the promise of predicting the \\nfuture. Is it psychohistorical predictions of which you are speaking?”\\n\\n“No. I have not yet reached the point in psychohistory where I can speak of the future \\nwith certainty. But you don’t need psychohistory to know that the Empire is \\ndisintegrating. You can see the evidence yourself.”\\n\\nZenow sighed. “My work here consumes me utterly, Professor Seldon. I am a child \\nwhen it comes to political and social matters.”\\n\\n“You may, if you wish, consult the information contained in the Library. Why look \\naround this very office--it is chock-full of every conceivable sort of information from \\nthroughout the entire Galactic Empire.”\\n\\n“I’m the last to keep up with it all, I’m afraid,” Zenow said, smiling sadly. “You know \\nthe old proverb: The shoemaker’s child has no shoes. It seems to me, though, that the \\nEmpire is restored. We have an Emperor again.”\\n\\n“In name only, Chief Librarian. In most of the outlying provinces, the Emperor’s name \\nis mentioned ritualistically now and then, but he plays no role in what they do. The \\nOuter Worlds control their own programs and, more important, they control the local \\narmed forces, which are outside the grip of the Emperor’s authority. If the Emperor were \\nto try to exert his authority anywhere outside the Inner Worlds, he would fail. I doubt \\nthat it will take more than twenty years, at the outside, before some of the Outer Worlds \\ndeclare their independence.”\\n\\nZenow sighed again. “If you are right, we live in worse times than the Empire has ever \\nseen. But what has this to do with your desire for more office space and additional staff \\nhere in the Library?”\\n\\n“If the Empire falls apart, the Galactic Library may not escape the general carnage.”\\n\\n“Oh, but it must,” said Zenow earnestly. “There have been bad times before and it has \\nalways been understood that the Galactic Library on Trantor, as the repository of all \\n\\n',\n",
              " 'human knowledge, must remain inviolate. And so it will be in the future.”\\n\\n“It may not be. You said yourself that the junta violated its neutrality.”\\n\\n“Not seriously.”\\n\\n“It might be more serious next time and we can’t allow this repository of all human \\nknowledge to be damaged.”\\n\\n“How will your increased presence here prevent that?”\\n\\n“It won’t. But the project I am interested in will. I want to create a great Encyclopedia, \\ncontaining within it all the knowledge humanity will need to rebuild itself in case the \\nworst happens--an Encyclopedia Galactica, if you will. We don’t need everything the \\nLibrary has. Much of it is trivial. The provincial libraries scattered over the Galaxy may \\nthemselves be destroyed and, if not, all but the most local data is obtained by \\ncomputerized connection with the Galactic Library in any case. What I intend, then, is \\nsomething that is entirely independent and that contains, in as concise a form as \\npossible, the essential information humanity needs.”\\n\\n“And if it, too, is destroyed?”\\n\\n“I hope it will not be. It is my intention to find a world far away on the outskirts of the \\nGalaxy, one where I can transfer my Encyclopedists and where they can work in peace. \\nUntil such a place is found, however, I want the nucleus of the group to work here and to \\nuse the Library facilities to decide what will be needed for the project.”\\n\\nZenow grimaced. “I see your point, Professor Seldon, but I’m not sure that it can be \\ndone.”\\n\\n“Why not, Chief Librarian?”\\n\\n“Because being Chief Librarian does not make me an absolute monarch. I have a rather \\nlarge Board--a kind of legislature--and please don’t think that I can just push your \\nEncyclopedia Project through.”\\n\\n“I’m astonished.”\\n\\n“Don’t be. I am not a popular Chief Librarian. The Board has been fighting, for some \\nyears now, for limited access to the Library. I have resisted. It galls them that I have \\nafforded you your small office space.”\\n\\n',\n",
              " '“Limited access?”\\n\\n“Exactly. The idea is that if anyone needs information, he or she must communicate with \\na Librarian and the Librarian will get the information for the person. The Board does not \\nwish people to enter the Library freely and deal with the computers themselves. They \\nsay that the expense required to keep the computers and other Library equipment in \\nshape is becoming prohibitive.”\\n\\n“But that’s impossible. There’s a millennial tradition of an open Galactic Library.”\\n\\n“So there is, but in recent years, appropriations to the Library have been cut several \\ntimes and we simply don’t have the funds we used to have. It is becoming very difficult \\nto keep our equipment up to the mark.”\\n\\nSeldon rubbed his chin. “But if your appropriations are going down, I imagine you have \\nto cut salaries and fire people--or, at least, not hire new ones.”\\n\\n“You are exactly right.”\\n\\n“In which case, how will you manage to place new labors on a shrinking work force by \\nasking your people to obtain all the information that the public will request?”\\n\\n“The idea is that we won’t find all the information that the public will request but only \\nthose pieces of information thatwe consider important.”\\n\\n“So that not only will you abandon the open Library but also the complete Library?”\\n\\n“I’m afraid so.”\\n\\n“I can’t believe that any Librarian would want this.”\\n\\n“You don’t know Gennaro Mummery, Professor Seldon.” At Seldon’s blank look, \\nZenow continued. “ ‘Who is he?’ you wonder. The leader of that portion of the Board \\nthat wishes to close off the Library. More and more of the Board are on his side. If I let \\nyou and your colleagues into the Library as an independent force, a number of Board \\nmembers who may not be on Mummery’s side but who are dead set against any control \\nof any part of the Library except by Librarians may decide to vote with him. And in that \\ncase, I will be forced to resign as Chief Librarian.”\\n\\n“See here,” said Seldon with sudden energy. “All this business of possibly closing down \\nthe Library, of making it less accessible, of refusing all information--all this business of \\ndeclining appropriations--all this is itself a sign of Imperial disintegration.

              " 'agree?”\\n\\n“If you put it that way, you may be right.”\\n\\n“Then let me talk to the Board. Let me explain what the future may hold and what I wish \\nto do. Perhaps I can persuade them, as I hope I’ve persuaded you.”\\n\\nZenow thought for a moment. “I’m willing to let you try, but you must know in advance \\nthat your plan may not work.”\\n\\n“I’ve got to take that chance. Please do whatever has to be done and let me know when \\nand where I can meet the Board.”\\n\\nSeldon left Zenow in a mood of unease. Everything he had told the Chief Librarian was \\ntrue--and trivial. The real reason he needed the use of the Library remained hidden.\\n\\nPartly this was because he didn’t yet see that use clearly himself.\\n\\n  \\n\\n 9\\n\\n  \\n\\n      Hari Seldon sat at Yugo Amaryl’s bedside--patiently, sadly. Yugo was utterly spent. \\nHe was beyond medical help, even if he would have consented to avail himself of such \\nhelp, which he refused.\\n\\nHe was only fifty-five. Seldon was himself sixty-six and yet he was in fine shape, except \\nfor the twinge of sciatica--or whatever it was--that occasionally lamed him.\\n\\nAmaryl’s eyes opened. “You’re still here, Hari?”\\n\\nSeldon nodded. “I won’t leave you.”\\n\\n“Till I die?”\\n\\n“Yes.” Then, in an outburst of grief, he said, “Why have you done this, Yugo? If you had \\nlived sensibly, you could have had twenty to thirty more years of life.”\\n\\nAmaryl smiled faintly. “Live sensibly? You mean, take time off? Go to resorts? Amuse \\nmyself with trifles?”\\n\\n',\n",
              " '“Yes. Yes.”\\n\\n“What about me?”\\n\\n“And I would either have longed to return to my work or I would have learned to like \\nwasting my time and, in the additional twenty to thirty years you speak of, I would have \\naccomplished no more. Look at you.”\\n\\n“For ten years you were First Minister under Cleon. How much science did you do \\nthen?”\\n\\n“I spent about a quarter of my time on psychohistory,” said Seldon gently.\\n\\n“You exaggerate. If it hadn’t been for me, plugging away, psychohistorical advance \\nwould have screeched to a halt.”\\n\\nSeldon nodded. “You are right, Yugo. For that I am grateful.”\\n\\n“And before and since, when you spend at least half your time on administrative duties, \\nwho does--did--the real work? Eh?”\\n\\n“You, Yugo.”\\n\\n“Absolutely.” His eyes closed again.\\n\\nSeldon said, “Yet you always wanted to take over those administrative duties if you \\nsurvived me.”\\n\\n“No! I wanted to head the Project to keep it moving in the direction it had to move in, \\nbut I would have delegated all administration.”\\n\\nAmaryl’s breathing was growing stertorous, but then he stirred and his eyes opened, \\nstaring directly at Hari. He said, “What will happen to psychohistory when I’m gone? \\nHave you thought of that?”\\n\\n“Yes, I have. And I want to speak to you about it. It may please you. Yugo, I believe that \\npsychohistory is being revolutionized.”\\n\\nAmaryl frowned slightly. “In what way? I don’t like the sound of that.”\\n\\n“Listen. It was your idea. Years ago, you told me that two Foundations should be \\n\\n',\n",
              " 'established. Separate--isolated and safe--and arranged so that they would serve as nuclei \\nfor an eventual Second Galactic Empire. Do you remember? That was your idea.”\\n\\n“The psychohistoric equations--”\\n\\n“I know. They suggested it. I’m busy working on it now, Yugo. I’ve managed to wangle \\nan office in the Galactic Library--”\\n\\n“The Galactic Library.” Amaryl’s frown deepened. “I don’t like diem. A bunch of self-\\nsatisfied idiots.”\\n\\n“The Chief Librarian, Las Zenow, is not so bad, Yugo.”\\n\\n“Did you ever meet a Librarian named Mummery, Gennaro Mummery?”\\n\\n“No, but I’ve heard of him.”\\n\\n“A miserable human being. We had an argument once when he claimed I had misplaced \\nsomething or other. I had done no such thing and I grew very annoyed, Hari. All of a \\nsudden I was back in Dahl. One thing about the Dahlite culture, Hari, it is a cesspool of \\ninvective. I used some of it on him and I told him he was interfering with psychohistory \\nand he would go down in history as a villain. I didn’t just say ‘villain,’ either.” Amaryl \\nchuckled faintly. “I left him speechless.”\\n\\nSuddenly Seldon could see where Mummery’s animosity toward outsiders and, most \\nprobably, psychohistory must come from--at least, in part--but he said nothing.\\n\\n“The point is, Yugo, you wanted two Foundations, so that if one failed, the other would \\ncontinue. But we’ve gone beyond that.”\\n\\n“Do you remember that Wanda was able to read your mind two years ago and see that \\nsomething was wrong with a portion of the equations in the Prime Radiant?”\\n\\n“In what way?”\\n\\n“Yes, of course.”\\n\\n“Well, we will find others like Wanda. We will have one Foundation that will consist \\nlargely of physical scientists, who will preserve the knowledge of humanity and serve as \\nthe nucleus for the Second Empire. And there will be a Second Foundation of \\npsychohistorians only--mentalists, mind-touching psychohistorians--who will be able to \\nwork on psychohistory in a multiminded way, advancing it far more quickly than \\n\\n',\n",
              " 'individual thinkers ever could. They will serve as a group who will introduce fine \\nadjustments as time goes on, you see. Ever in the background, watching. They will be \\nthe Empire’s guardians.”\\n\\n“Wonderful!” said Amaryl weakly. “Wonderful! You see how I’ve chosen the right time \\nto die? There’s nothing left for me to do.”\\n\\n“Don’t say that, Yugo.”\\n\\n“Don’t make such a fuss over it, Hari. I’m too tired to do anything. Thank you--thank \\nyou--for telling me”--his voice was weakening--”about the revolution. It makes me--\\nhappy--happy--hap--”\\n\\nAnd those were Yugo Amaryl’s last words.\\n\\nSeldon bent over the bed. Tears stung his eyes and rolled down his cheeks.\\n\\nAnother old friend gone. Demerzel, Cleon, Dors, now Yugo . . . leaving him emptier and \\nlonelier as he grew old.\\n\\nAnd the revolution that had allowed Amaryl to die happy might never come to pass. \\nCould he manage to make use of the Galactic Library? Could he find more people like \\nWanda? Most of all, how long would it take?\\n\\nSeldon was sixty-six. If only he could have started this revolution at thirty-two when he \\nfirst came to Trantor . . . .\\n\\nNow it might be too late.\\n\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\n 10\\n\\n      Gennaro Mummery was making him wait. It was a studied discourtesy, even \\ninsolence, but Hari Seldon remained calm.\\n\\nAfter all, Seldon needed Mummery badly and for him to become angry with the \\nLibrarian would only hurt himself. Mummery would, in fact, be delighted with an angry \\nSeldon.\\n\\n',\n",
              " 'So Seldon kept his temper and waited and eventually Mummery did walk in. Seldon had \\nseen him before--but only at a distance. This was the first time they would be together \\nalone.\\n\\nMummery was short and plump, with a round face and a dark little beard. He wore a \\nsmile on his face, but Seldon suspected that smile of being a meaningless fixture. It \\nrevealed yellowish teeth and Mummery’s inevitable hat was of a similar shade of yellow \\nwith a brown line snaking around it.\\n\\nSeldon felt a touch of nausea. It seemed to him that he would dislike Mummery, even if \\nhe had no reason to do so.\\n\\nMummery said, without any preliminaries, “Well, Professor, what can I do for you?” He \\nlooked at the time-strip on the wall but made no apology for being late.\\n\\nSeldon said, “I would like to ask you, sir, to put an end to your opposition to my \\nremaining here at the Library.”\\n\\nMummery spread his hands. “You’ve been here for two years. What Opposition are you \\nspeaking of?”\\n\\n“So far, that portion of the Board represented by you and those who believe as you do \\nhave been unable to outvote the Chief Librarian, but there will be another meeting next \\nmonth and Las Zenow tells me he is uncertain of the result.”\\n\\nMummery shrugged. “So am I uncertain. Your lease--if we can call it that--may well be \\nrenewed.”\\n\\n“But I need more than that, Librarian Mummery. I wish to bring in some colleagues. The \\nproject in which I am engaged--the establishment of what is needed in the way of the \\neventual preparation of a very special Encyclopedia--is not one I can do alone.”\\n\\n“Surely your colleagues can work wherever they please. Trantor is a large world.”\\n\\n“We must work in the Library. I am an old man, sir, and I am in a hurry.”\\n\\n“Who can stay the advance of time? I don’t think the Board will allow you to bring in \\ncolleagues. The thin edge of the wedge, Professor?”\\n\\n(Yes, indeed, thought Seldon, but he said nothing.)\\n\\nMummery said, “I have not been able to keep you out, Professor. Not so far. But I think I \\n\\n',\n",
              " 'can continue to keep out your colleagues.”\\n\\nSeldon realized that he was getting nowhere. He opened the touch of frankness a notch. \\nHe said, “Librarian Mummery, surely your animosity toward me is not personal. Surely \\nyou understand the importance of the work I am doing.”\\n\\n“You mean, your psychohistory. Come, you have been working on it for over thirty \\nyears. What has come of it?”\\n\\n“That’s the point. Something may come of it now.”\\n\\n“Then let something come of it at Streeling University. Why must it be at the Galactic \\nLibrary?”\\n\\n“Librarian Mummery. Listen to me. What you want is to close the Library to the public. \\nYou wish to smash a long tradition. Have you the heart to do that?”\\n\\n“It’s not heart we need. It’s funding. Surely the Chief Librarian has wept on your \\nshoulder in telling you our woes. Appropriations are down, salaries are cut, needed \\nmaintenance is absent. What are we to do? We’ve got to cut services and we certainly \\ncan’t afford to support you and your colleagues with offices and equipment.”\\n\\n“Has this situation been put to the Emperor?”\\n\\n“Come, Professor, you’re dreaming. Isn’t it true that your psychohistory tells you that \\nthe Empire is deteriorating? I’ve heard you referred to as Raven Seldon, something that, \\nI believe, refers to a fabled bird of ill omen.”\\n\\n“It’s true that we are entering bad times.”\\n\\n“And do you believe the Library is immune to those bad times? Professor, the Library is \\nmy life and I want it to continue, but it won’t continue unless we can find ways of \\nmaking our dwindling appropriations do. --and you come here expecting an open \\nLibrary, with yourself as beneficiary. It won’t do, Professor. It just won’t do.”\\n\\nSeldon said desperately, “What if I find the credits for you?”\\n\\n“Indeed. How?”\\n\\n“What if I talk to the Emperor? I was once First Minister. He’ll see me and he’ll listen to \\nme.”\\n\\n',\n",
              " '“And you’ll get funding from him?” Mummery laughed.\\n\\n“If I do, if I increase your appropriations, may I bring in my colleagues?”\\n\\n“Bring in the credits first,” said Mummery, “and we’ll see. But I don’t think you will \\nsucceed.”\\n\\nHe seemed very sure of himself and Seldon wondered how often and how uselessly the \\nGalactic Library had already appealed to the Emperor.\\n\\nAnd whether his own appeal would get anywhere at all.\\n\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\n 11\\n\\n      The Emperor Agis XIV had no real right to the name. He had adopted it upon \\nsucceeding to the throne with the deliberate purpose of connecting himself with the \\nAgises who had ruled two thousand years ago, most of them quite ably--particularly \\nAgis VI, who had ruled for forty-two years and who had kept order in a prosperous \\nEmpire with a firm but nontyrannical hand.\\n\\nAgis XIV did not look like any of the old Agises--if the holographic records had any \\nvalue. But, then again, truth be told, Agis XIV did not look much like the official \\nholograph that was distributed to the public.\\n\\nAs a matter of fact, Hari Seldon thought, with a twinge of nostalgia, that Emperor Cleon, \\nfor all his flaws and weaknesses, had certainly looked Imperial.\\n\\nAgis XIV did not. Seldon had never seen him at close quarters and the few holographs \\nhe had seen were outrageously inaccurate. The Imperial holographer knew his job and \\ndid it well, thought Seldon wryly.\\n\\nAgis XIV was short, with an unattractive face and slightly bulging eyes that did not \\nseem alight with intelligence. His only qualification for the throne was that he was a \\ncollateral relative of Cleon.\\n\\nTo do him credit, however, he did not try to play the role of the mighty Emperor. It was \\nunderstood that he rather liked to be called the “Citizen Emperor” and that only Imperial \\nprotocol and the outraged outcry of the Imperial Guard prevented him from exiting the \\n\\n',\n",
              " 'dome and wandering the walkways of Trantor. Apparently, the story went, he wished to \\nshake hands with the citizens and hear their complaints in person.\\n\\n(Score one for him, thought Seldon, even if it could never come to pass.)\\n\\nWith a murmur and a bow, Seldon said, “I thank you, Sire, for consenting to see me.”\\n\\nAgis XIV had a clear and rather attractive voice, quite out of keeping with his \\nappearance. He said, “An ex-First Minister must surely have his privileges, although I \\nmust give myself credit for amazing courage in agreeing to see you.”\\n\\nThere was humor in his words and Seldon found himself suddenly realizing that a man \\nmight not look intelligent and yet might be intelligent just the same.\\n\\n“Courage, Sire?”\\n\\n“Why, of course. Don’t they call you Raven Seldon?”\\n\\n“I heard the expression, Sire, the other day for the first time.”\\n\\n“Apparently the reference is to your psychohistory, which seems to predict the Fall of \\nthe Empire.”\\n\\n“It points out the possibility only, Sire--”\\n\\n“So that you are coupled with a mythic bird of ill omen. Except that I think you yourself \\nare the bird of ill omen.”\\n\\n“I hope not, Sire.”\\n\\n“Come, come. The record is clear. Eto Demerzel, Cleon’s old First Minister, was \\nimpressed with your work and look what happened--he was forced out of his position \\nand into exile. The Emperor Cleon himself was impressed with your work and look what \\nhappened--he was assassinated. The military junta was impressed with your work and \\nlook what happened--they were swept away. Even the Joranumites, it is said, were \\nimpressed with your work and, behold, they were destroyed. And now, O Raven Seldon, \\nyou come to see me. What may I expect?”\\n\\n“Why, nothing evil, Sire.”\\n\\n“I imagine not, because unlike all these others I have mentioned, I am not impressed \\nwith your work. Now tell me why you are here.”\\n\\n',\n",
              " 'He listened carefully and without interruption while Seldon explained the importance of \\nsetting up a Project designed to prepare an encyclopedia that would preserve human \\nlearning if the worst happened.\\n\\n“Yes yes,” said Agis XIV finally, “so you are, indeed, convinced the Empire will fall.”\\n\\n“It is a strong possibility, Sire, and it would not be prudent to refuse to take that \\npossibility into account. In a way, I wish to prevent it if I can --or ameliorate the effects \\nif I can’t.”\\n\\n“Raven Seldon if you continue to poke your nose into matters, I am convinced that the \\nEmpirewill fall and that nothing can help it.”\\n\\n“Not so, Sire. I ask only permission to work.”\\n\\n“Oh, you have that, but I fail to see what it is you wish of me. Why have you told me all \\nthis about an encyclopedia?”\\n\\n“Because I wish to work in the Galactic Library, Sire, or, more accurately, I wish others \\nto work there with me.”\\n\\n“I assure you that I won’t stand in your way.”\\n\\n“That is not enough, Sire. I want you to help.”\\n\\n“In what way, ex-First Minister?”\\n\\n“With funding. The Library must have appropriations or it will close its doors to the \\npublic and evict me.”\\n\\n“Credits!’“ A note of astonishment came into the Emperor’s voice. “You came to me for \\ncredits?”\\n\\n“Yes, Sire.”\\n\\nAgis XIV stood up in some agitation. Seldon stood up at once also, but Agis waved him \\ndown.\\n\\n“Sit down. Don’t treat me as an Emperor. I’m not an Emperor. I didn’t want this job, but \\nthey made me take it.

Of \\ndisorders here and there?\\n\\n“No. Think ofcredits . Do you realize that I cannot collect any taxes at all from half the \\nprovinces in the Empire? They’re still part of the Empire--’Hail the Imperium! --’All \\nhonor to the Emperor’--but they don’t pay anything and I don’t have the necessary force \\nto collect it. And if I can’t get the credits out of them, they are not really part of the \\nEmpire, are they?\\n\\n“Credits! The Empire runs a chronic deficit of appalling proportions.\\n\\nThere’s nothing I can pay for. Do you think there is enough funding to maintain the \\nImperial Palace grounds? Just barely. I must cut corners. I must let the Palace decay. I \\nmust let the number of retainers die down by attrition.\\n\\n“Professor Seldon. If you want credits, I have nothing. Where will I find appropriations \\nfor the Library? They should be grateful I manage to squeeze out something for them \\neach year at all.” As he finished, the Emperor held out his hands, palms up, as if to \\nsignify the emptiness of the Imperial coffers.\\n\\nHari Seldon was stunned. He said, “Nevertheless, Sire, even if you lack the credits, you \\nstill have the Imperial prestige. Can you not order the Library to allow me to keep my \\noffice and let my colleagues in to help me with our vital work?”\\n\\nAnd now Agis XIV sat down again as though, once the subject was not credits, he was \\nno longer in a state of agitation.\\n\\nHe said, “You realize that, by long tradition, the Galactic Library is independent of the \\nImperium, as far as its self-government is concerned. It sets up its rules and has done so \\nsince Agis VI, my namesake”--he smiled--”attempted to control the news functions of \\nthe Library. He failed and, if the great Agis VI failed, do you think I can succeed?”\\n\\n“I’m not asking you to use force, Sire. Merely expressing a polite wish. Surely, when no \\nvital function of the Library is involved, they will be pleased to honor the Emperor and \\noblige his wishes.”\\n\\n“Professor Seldon, how little you know of the Library. I have but to express a wish, \\nhowever gently and tentatively, to make it certain that they will proceed, in dudgeon, to \\ndo the opposite. They are very sensitive to the slightest sign of Imperial control.”\\n\\n',\n",
              " 'Seldon said, “Then what do I do?”\\n\\n“Why, I’ll tell you what. A thought occurs to me. I am a member of the public and I can \\nvisit the Galactic Library if I wish. It is located on the Palace grounds, so I won’t be \\nviolating protocol if I visit it. Well, you come with me and we shall be ostentatiously \\nfriendly. I will not ask them for anything, but if they note us walking arm-in-arm, then \\nperhaps some of the precious Board of theirs may feel more kindly toward you than \\notherwise. --but that’s all I can do.”\\n\\nAnd the deeply disappointed Seldon wondered if that could possibly be enough.\\n\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\n 12\\n\\n      Las Zenow said with a certain trace of awe in his voice, “I didn’t know you were so \\nfriendly with the Emperor, Professor Seldon.”\\n\\n“Why not?

We haven’t had an Emperor in our halls for many \\nyears. Generally, when the Emperor needs something from the Library--”\\n\\n“I can imagine. He calls for it and it is brought to him as a matter of courtesy.”\\n\\n“There was once a suggestion,” said Zenow chattily, “that the Emperor be outfitted with \\na complete set of computerized equipment in his palace, hooked directly into the Library \\nsystem, so that he would not need to wait for service. This was in the old days when \\ncredits were plentiful, but, you know, it was voted down.”\\n\\n“Was it?”\\n\\n“Oh yes, almost the entire Board agreed that it would make the Emperor too much a part \\nof the Library and that this would threaten our independence from the government.”\\n\\n“And does this Board, which will not bend to honor an Emperor, consent to let me \\nremain at the Library?”\\n\\n“At the present moment, yes.

The Emperor was seen walking only with \\nyou--not with your colleagues. I’m sorry, Professor.”\\n\\nSeldon shrugged and a mood of deep melancholy swept over him. He had no colleague \\nto bring in, anyhow. For some time he had hoped to locate others like Wanda and he had \\nfailed. He, too, would need funding to mount an adequate search. And he, too, had \\nnothing.\\n\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\n 13\\n\\n      Trantor, the capital world-city of the Galactic Empire, had changed considerably \\nsince the day Hari first stepped off the hypership from his native Helicon thirty-eight \\nyears ago. Was it the pearly haze of an old man’s memory that made the Trantor of old \\nshine so brightly in his mind’s eye, Hari wondered. Or perhaps it had been the \\nexuberance of youth--how could a young man from a provincial Outer World such as \\nHelicon not be impressed by the gleaming towers, sparkling domes, the colorful, rushing \\nmasses of people that had seemed to swirl through Trantor, day and night.\\n\\nNow, Hari thought sadly, the walkways are nearly deserted, even in the full light of day. \\nRoving gangs of thugs controlled various areas of the city, competing among themselves \\nfor territory. The security establishment had dwindled; those who were left had their \\nhands full processing complaints at the central office. Of course, security officers were \\ndispatched as emergency calls came through, but they made it to the scene onlyafter a \\ncrime was committed--they no longer made even a pretense of protecting the citizens of \\nTrantor. A person went out at his own risk--and a great risk it was. And yet Hari Seldon \\nstill took that risk, in the form of a daily walk, as if defying the forces that were \\ndestroying his beloved Empire to destroy him as well.\\n\\nAnd so Hari Seldon walked along, limping--and thoughtful.\\n\\n',\n",
              " 'Nothing worked. Nothing. He had been unable to isolate the genetic pattern that set \\nWanda apart--and without that, he was unable to locate others like her.\\n\\nWanda’s ability to read minds had sharpened considerably in the six years since she had \\nidentified the flaw in Yugo Amaryl’s Prime Radiant. Wanda was special in more ways \\nthan one. It was as if, once she realized that her mental ability set her apart from other \\npeople, she was determined to understand it, to harness its energy, to direct it. As she had \\nprogressed through her teen years, she had matured, throwing off the girlish giggles that \\nhad so endeared her to Hari, at the same time becoming even dearer to him in her \\ndetermination to help him in his work with the powers of her “gift.” For Hari Seldon had \\ntold Wanda about his plan for a Second Foundation and she had committed herself to \\nrealizing that goal with him.\\n\\nToday, though, Seldon was in a dark mood. He was coming to the conclusion that \\nWanda’s mentalic ability would get him nowhere. He had no credits to continue his \\nwork--no credits to locate others like Wanda, no credits to pay his workers on the \\nPsychohistory Project at Streeling, no credits to set up his all-important Encyclopedia \\nProject at the Galactic Library.\\n\\nNow what?\\n\\nHe continued to walk toward the Galactic Library. He would have been better off taking \\na gravicab, but he wanted to walk-limp or not. He needed time to think.\\n\\nHe heard a cry--”There he is!”--but paid no attention.\\n\\nIt came again. “There he is! Psychohistory!”\\n\\nThe word forced him to look up. --Psychohistory.\\n\\nA group of young men was closing in around him.\\n\\nAutomatically Seldon placed his back against the wall and raised his cane. “What is it \\nyou want?”\\n\\nThey laughed. “Credits, old man. Do you have any credits?”\\n\\n“Maybe, but why do you want them from me? You said, ‘Psychohistory!’ Do you know \\nwho I am?”\\n\\n“Sure, you’re Raven Seldon” said the young man in the lead.

What are we \\ngoing to do?”\\n\\nSeldon looked around swiftly. There were no security officers around. Another \\nindication of the deterioration of society. An occasional person or two passed by, but \\nthere was no use calling for help. Their footsteps increased in speed and made a wide \\ndetour. No one was going to run any risks of getting involved in an imbroglio.\\n\\nSeldon said, “The first one of you who approaches gets a cracked head.”\\n\\n“Yeah?” And the leader stepped forward rapidly and seized the cane. There was a short \\nsharp struggle and the cane was wrested from Seldon’s grip. The leader tossed it to one \\nside.\\n\\n“Now what, old man?”\\n\\nSeldon shrunk back. He could only wait for the blows. They crowded around him, each \\neager to land a blow or two. Seldon lifted his arms to try to ward them off. He could still \\nTwist--after a fashion. If he were facing only one or two, he might be able to Twist his \\nbody, avoid their blows, strike back. But not against eight--surely not against eight.\\n\\n',\n",

Get back, you thugs! \\nBack or I’ll kill you all!”\\n\\nThe leader said, “Well, another old man.”\\n\\n“Not that old,” said the newcomer. With the back of one hand, he struck the leader’s \\nface, turning it an ugly red.\\n\\nSeldon said in surprise, “Raych, it’s you.”\\n\\nRaych’s hand swept back. “Stay out of this, Dad. Just get up and move away.”\\n\\nThe leader, rubbing his cheek, said, “We’ll get you for that.”\\n\\n“No, you won’t,” said Raych, drawing out a knife of Dahlite manufacture, long and \\ngleaming. A second knife was withdrawn and he now held one in each hand.\\n\\nSeldon said weakly, “Still carrying knives, Raych?”\\n\\n“Always,” said Raych. “Nothing will ever make me stop.”\\n\\n“I’ll stop you,” said the leader, drawing out a blaster.\\n\\nFaster than the eye could follow, one of Raych’s knives went sailing through the air and \\nstruck the leader’s throat.

He said, “I don’t like to use \\na blaster, you bunch of good-for-nothings, because sometimes I miss. I never miss with a \\nknife, however. Never! That man is dead. There are seven of you standing. Do you \\nintend to stay standing or will you leave?”\\n\\n“Get him!” shouted one of the hoodlums and the seven made a concerted rush.\\n\\n',\n",

That leaves five of you on your feet. Are you \\ngoing to attack again or are you going to leave?”\\n\\nThey turned and Raych called out, “Pick up your dead and dying.

Get into my car and I’ll give you a lift back to \\nStreeling.”\\n\\nHe programmed the ground-car quietly, then said, “What a shame we didn’t have Dors \\nwith us. Mom would have attacked them with her bare lands and left all eight dead in \\nfive minutes.”\\n\\nSeldon felt tears stinging his eyelids. “I know, Raych, I know. Do you think I don’t miss \\nher every day?”\\n\\n“I’m sorry,” said Raych in a low voice.\\n\\nSeldon asked, “How did you know I was in trouble?”\\n\\n“Wanda told me. She said there were evil people lying in wait for you ,slid told me \\nwhere they were and I took right off.”\\n\\n“Didn’t you doubt that she knew what she was talking about?”\\n\\n“Not at all.

Why do you suppose that was?”\\n\\n“That’s because you live in a world all your own, Dad, and you don’t know what’s going \\non on Trantor.

There’s no world in all the Empire that’s deteriorating the way Trantor is. It’s \\nbecome a haunt of crime with no one to protect us. The economy is limping, the \\ntechnology is failing.

All I could do was warn you he was there and you \\ndid the rest.”\\n\\n“The second man ran away.”\\n\\n“Because you clobbered the first guy. I had nothing to do with it.” She broke out again \\nin tears of frustration. “And then the magistrate. I insisted on the magistrate. I thought I \\nwould push and he would let you go at once.”\\n\\n“He did let me go and it was practically at once.”\\n\\n“No. He put you through a miserable routine and saw the light only when he realized \\nwho you were. I had nothing to do with it. I flopped everywhere. I could have gotten you \\ninto so much trouble.”\\n\\n“No, I refuse to accept that, Wanda. If your pushing didn’t work quite as well as you had \\nhoped it would, it was only because you were working under emergency conditions. You \\ncouldn’t have helped it. But, Wanda, look--I have an idea.”\\n\\nCatching the excitement in his voice, she looked up. “What kind of idea, Grandpa?”\\n\\n“Well, it’s like this, Wanda. You probably realize that I’ve got to have credits. \\nPsychohistory simply can’t continue without it and I cannot bear the thought of having it \\nall come to nothing after so many years of hard work.”\\n\\n“I can’t bear it, either. But how can we get the credits?”\\n\\n“Well, I’m going to request an audience with the Emperor again. I’ve seen him once \\nalready and he’s a good man and I like him. But he’s not exactly drowning in wealth. \\nHowever, if I take you with me and if you push him--gently--it may be that he will find a \\nsource of credits, some source somewhere, and keep me going for a while, till I can \\nthink of something else.”\\n\\n“Do you really think it will work, Grandpa?”\\n\\n“Not without you. But with you--maybe. Come, isn’t it worth trying?”\\n\\n',\n",

Agis’s eyes sparkled as he greeted Hari \\nSeldon. “Hello, old friend,” he said. “Have you come to bring me bad luck?”\\n\\n“I hope not,” said Seldon.\\n\\nAgis unhooked the elaborate cloak he was wearing and, with a weary grunt, threw it into \\nthe corner of the room, saying, “Andyou lie there.”\\n\\nHe looked at Seldon and shook his head. “I hate that thing. It’s as heavy as sin and as hot \\nas blazes. I always have to wear it when I’m being smothered under meaningless words, \\nstanding there upright like a carved image. It’s just plain horrible. Cleon was born to it \\nand he had the appearance for it. I was not and I don’t. It’s just my misery that I’m a \\nthird cousin of his on my mother’s side so that I qualified as Emperor. I’d be glad to sell \\nit for a very small sum. Would you like to be Emperor, Hari?”\\n\\n“No no, I wouldn’t dream of it, so don’t get your hopes up,” said Seldon, laughing.\\n\\n“But tell me, who is this extraordinarily beautiful young woman you have brought with \\nyou today?”\\n\\nWanda flushed and the Emperor said genially, “You mustn’t let me embarrass you, my \\ndear. One of the few perquisites an Emperor possesses is the right to say anything he \\nchooses. No one can object or argue :bout it. They can only say, ‘Sire.’ However, I don’t \\nwant any ‘Sires’ from you. I hate that word. Call me Agis. That is not my birth name, \\neither. It’s my Imperial name and I’ve got to get used to it. So . . . tell me what’s doing, \\nHari. What’s been happening to you since the last time we met?”\\n\\nSeldon said briefly, “I’ve been attacked twice.”\\n\\nThe Emperor didn’t seem to be sure whether this was a joke or not. He said, “Twice? \\nReally?”\\n\\nThe Emperor’s face darkened as Seldon told the story of the assaults. “I suppose there \\n\\n',\n",

Then he turned and \\nfaced Seldon.\\n\\n“For thousands of years,” he began, “whenever something like this happened, people \\nwould say, ‘Why don’t we appeal to the Emperor?’ or ‘Why doesn’t the Emperor do \\nsomething?’ And, in the end, the Emperorcan do something anddoes do something, even \\nif it isn’t always the intelligent thing to do. But I . . . Hari, I’m powerless. Absolutely \\npowerless.\\n\\n“Oh yes, there is the so-called Commission of Public Safety, but they seem more \\nconcerned withmy safety than that of the public. It’s a wonder we’re having this \\naudience at all, for you are not at all popular with the Commission.\\n\\n“There’snothing I can do about anything. Do you know what’s happened to the status of \\nthe Emperor since the fall of the junta and the restoration of--hah!--Imperial power?”\\n\\n“I’ll bet you don’t--fully. We’ve got democracy now. Do you know what democracy is?”\\n\\n“I think I do.”\\n\\n“Certainly.”\\n\\nAgis frowned. He said, “I’ll bet you think it’s a good thing.”\\n\\n“I think itcan be a good thing.”\\n\\n“Well, there you are. It isn’t. It’s completely upset the Empire.\\n\\n“Suppose I want to order more officers onto the streets of Trantor. In the old days, I \\nwould pull over a piece of paper prepared for me by the Imperial Secretary and would \\nsign it with a flourish--and there would be more security officers.\\n\\n“Now I can’t do anything of the sort. I have to put it before the Legislature. There are \\nseventy-five hundred men and women who instantly turn into uncounted gaggles of \\ngeese the instant a suggestion is made. In the first place, where is the funding to come \\nfrom? You can’t have, say, ten thousand more officers without having to pay ten \\nthousand more salaries.

Oh, the lights will be fixed, but it \\ncan easily take a few months to do it.That’s democracy.”\\n\\nHari Seldon said, “As I recall, the Emperor Cleon was forever complaining that he could \\nnot do what he wished to do.”\\n\\n“The Emperor Cleon,” said Agis impatiently, “had two first-class First Ministers--\\nDemerzel and yourself--and you each labored to keep Cleon from doing anything \\nfoolish. I have seventy-five hundred First Ministers, all of whom are foolish from start to \\nfinish. But surely, Hari, you haven’t come to complain to me about the attacks.”\\n\\n“No, I haven’t. Something much worse. Sire--Agis--I need credits.”\\n\\nThe Emperor stared at him. “After what I’ve been telling you, Hari? I have no credits. --\\nOh yes, there’re credits to run this establishment, of course, but in order to get them I \\nhave to face my seventy-five hundred legislators. If you think I can go to them and say, \\n‘I want credits for my friend, Hari Seldon’ and if you think I’ll get one quarter of what I \\nask for in anything less than two years, you’re crazy. It won’t happen.”\\n\\nHe shrugged and said, more gently, “Don’t get me wrong, Hari. I would like to help you \\nif I could. I would particularly like to help you for the sake of your granddaughter. \\nLooking at her makes me feel as though I should give you all the credits you would \\nlike--but it can’t be done.”\\n\\nSeldon said, “Agis, if I don’t get funding, psychohistory will go down the drain--after \\nnearly forty years.”\\n\\n“It’s come to nothing in nearly forty years, so why worry?”\\n\\n“Agis,” said Seldon “there’s nothing more I can do now. The assaults on me were \\nprecisely because I’m a psychohistorian. People consider me a predictor of destruction.”\\n\\nThe Emperor nodded. “You’re bad luck, Raven Seldon. I told you this earlier.”\\n\\nSeldon stood up wretchedly. “I’m through, then.”\\n\\nWanda stood, too, next to Seldon the top of her head reaching her grandfather’s \\nshoulder. She gazed fixedly at the Emperor.\\n\\n',\n",

They don’t have legislators and can, if they wish, simply sign a credit \\nvoucher.”\\n\\nSeldon stared. “I’ll try that.”\\n\\n      “Mr. Bindris,” said Hari Seldon, reaching out his hand to shake the other’s. “I am so \\nglad to be able to see you. It was good of you to agree to see me.”\\n\\n“Why not?” said Terep Bindris jovially. “I know you well. Or, rather, I knowof you \\nwell.”\\n\\n“That’s pleasant. I take it you’ve heard of psychohistory, then.”\\n\\n“Oh yes, what intelligent person hasn’t? Not that Iunderstand anything about it, of \\ncourse.

Now, please, sit down and tell me what it is I can do for you.” He gestured \\nexpansively with his arm, indicating that they be seated on two overstuffed, richly \\nbrocaded chairs in front of the desk at which he sat. The chairs, like the ornate desk, the \\nimposing carved doors which had slid back noiselessly at their arrival signal, and the \\ngleaming obsidian floor of Bindris’s vast office, were of the finest quality. And, although \\nhis surroundings were impressive--and imposing--Bindris himself was not. The slight \\ncordial man would not be taken, at first glance, for one of Trantor’s leading financial \\npowerbrokers.\\n\\n“We’re here, sir, at the Emperor’s suggestion.”\\n\\n“The Emperor?”\\n\\n“Yes, he could not help us, but he thought a man like you might be able to do so. The \\nquestion, of course, is credits.”\\n\\nBindris’s face fell. “Credits?” he said. “I don’t understand.”\\n\\n“Well,” said Seldon, “for nearly forty years, psychohistory has been supported by the \\ngovernment. However, times change and the Empire is no longer what it was.”\\n\\n“Yes, I know that.”‘\\n\\n“The Emperor lacks the credits to support us or, even if he did have the credits, he \\ncouldn’t get the request for funding past the Legislature. He recommends, therefore, that \\nI see businesspeople who, in the first place, still have credits and, in the second place, \\ncan simply write out a credit voucher.”\\n\\nThere was a longish pause and Bindris finally said, “The Emperor, I’m afraid, knows \\nnothing about business. --How many credits do you want?”\\n\\n“Mr. Bindris, we’re talking about an enormous task. I’m going to need several million.”\\n\\n“Severalmillion !”\\n\\n“Yes, sir.”\\n\\n',\n",

When do you expect to be able to \\npay it back?”\\n\\n“Well, Mr. Bindris, I can’t honestly say I ever expect to be able to pay it back. I’m \\nlooking for a gift.”\\n\\n“Even if I wanted to give you the credits--and let me tell you, for some strange reason I \\nvery much want to do so--I couldn’t. The Emperor may have his Legislature, but I have \\nmy Board members. I can’t make a gift of that sort without the Board’s permission and \\nthey’ll never grant it.”\\n\\n“Why not? Your firm is enormously wealthy. A few million would mean nothing to \\nyou.”\\n\\n“That sounds good,” said Bindris, “but I’m afraid that the firm is in a state of decline \\nright now. Not sufficiently to bring us into serious trouble, but enough to make us \\nunhappy. If the Empire is in a state of decay, different individual parts of it are decaying, \\ntoo. We are in no position to Land out a few million. --I’m truly sorry.”\\n\\nSeldon sat there silently and Bindris seemed unhappy. He shook his Head at last and \\nsaid, “Look, Professor Seldon, I would really like to help you out, particularly for the \\nsake of the young lady you have with you. It just can’t be done. --However, we’re not \\nthe only firm in Trantor. Try others, Professor.

I simply don’t understand it. We’ve been to \\nfour different firms. Each one was ruder and nastier to us than the one before. The fourth \\none just kicked us out. And since then, no one will let us in.”\\n\\n“It’s no mystery, Wanda,” said Seldon gently. “When we saw Bindris, he didn’t know \\nwhat we were there for and he was perfectly friendly until I asked for a gift of a few \\n\\n',\n",
              " 'million credits. Then he was a great deal less friendly. I imagine the word went out as to \\nwhat we wanted and each additional time there was less friendliness until now, when \\npeople won’t receive us at all. Why should they? They’re not going to give us the credits \\nwe need, so why waste time with us?”\\n\\nWanda’s anger turned on herself. “And what did I do? I just sat there. Nothing.”\\n\\n“I wouldn’t say that,” said Seldon. “Bindris was affected by you. It seems to me that he \\nreally wanted to give me the credits, largely because of you. You were pushing him and \\naccomplishing something.”\\n\\n“Not nearly enough. Besides, all he cared about was that I was pretty.”\\n\\n“Not pretty,” muttered Seldon. “Beautiful. Very beautiful.”\\n\\n“So what do we do now, Grandpa?” asked Wanda. “After all these years, psychohistory \\nwill collapse.”\\n\\n“I suppose that,” said Seldon “in a way, it’s something that can’t be helped. I’ve been \\npredicting the breakdown of the Empire for nearly forty years and now that it’s come, \\npsychohistory breaks down with it.”\\n\\n“But psychohistory will save the Empire, at least partly.”\\n\\n“I know it will, but I can’t force it to.”\\n\\n“Are you just going to let it collapse?”\\n\\nSeldon shook his head. “I’ll try to keep it from doing so, but I must admit that I don’t \\nknow how I’m going to do it.”\\n\\nWanda said, “I’m going to practice. There must be some way I can strengthen my push, \\nmake it easier for me to force people to do what I want them to do.”\\n\\n“I wish you could manage.”\\n\\n“What are you going to do, Grandpa?”\\n\\n“Well, nothing much. Two days ago, when I was on my way to see the Chief Librarian, I \\nencountered three men in the Library who were arguing about psychohistory. For some \\nreason, one of them impressed me very much. I urged him to come see me and he \\nagreed. The appointment is for this afternoon at my office.”\\n\\n',\n",

Palver! Palver! The name sounds familiar.”\\n\\n“It should, Professor. My grandfather boasted frequently of having known you.”\\n\\n“Your grandfather. Of course. Joramis Palver. He was two years younger than I was, as I \\nrecall. I tried to get him to join me in psychohistory, but he refused. He said there was no \\nchance of his ever learning enough mathematics to make it possible. Too bad! How is \\nJoramis, by the way?”\\n\\nPalver said solemnly, “I’m afraid that Joramis has gone the way of old men generally. \\nHe’s dead.”\\n\\nSeldon winced. Two years younger than he himself was--and dead. An old friend and \\nthey had lost touch to such a degree that, when death came, it did so unknowingly.\\n\\n',\n",

Stop me if I’m wrong, but that’s not on Trantor, is it?”\\n\\n“No. I wanted to try a different world. The Universities on Trantor, as you undoubtedly \\nknow very well, are all overcrowded. I wanted to find a place where I could study in \\npeace.”\\n\\n“And what did you study?”\\n\\n“Nothing much. History. Not the sort of thing that would lead one to a good job.”\\n\\n(Another wince, even worse than the first. Dors Venabili had been a historian.)\\n\\nSeldon said, “But you’re back here on Trantor. Why is that?”\\n\\n“Credits. Jobs.”\\n\\n“As an historian?”\\n\\nPalver laughed. “Not a chance. I run a device that pulls and hauls. Not exactly a \\nprofessional occupation.”\\n\\nSeldon looked at Palver with a twinge of envy. The contours of Palver’s arms and chest \\nwere highlighted by the thin fabric of his shirt. He was well muscled. Seldon had never \\nhimself been quite that muscular.\\n\\nSeldon said, “I presume that when you were at the University, you were on the boxing \\nteam.”\\n\\n“Who, me? Never. I’m a Twister.”\\n\\n“A Twister!” Seldon’s spirits jumped. “Are you from Helicon?”\\n\\nPalver said with a certain contempt, “You don’t have to come from Helicon to be a good \\nTwister.”\\n\\n',\n",

The two ruffians who were still standing quickly \\ndropped to a crouch in preparation for attack. But Palver was quicker. They, too, were \\nfelled almost before they knew what hit them.\\n\\nAnd then it was over--almost as soon as it started. Seldon stood off to the side, leaning \\nheavily on his cane, shaking at the thought of his narrow escape. Palver, panting slightly \\nfrom exertion, surveyed the scene. The three attackers were out cold on the deserted \\nwalkway under the darkening dome.\\n\\n“Come on, let’s get out of here quickly!” Palver urged again, only this time it was not \\nthe attackers they would be fleeing.\\n\\n“Stettin, we can’t leave,” protested Seldon. He gestured toward the unconscious would-\\nbe muggers. “They’re really nothing more than children. They may be dying. How can \\nwe just walk away?

              " 'notwithstanding her position as one of the most revered interpreters of Imperial law, Lih \\nwas ever so slightlyvain about the colorful appearance she gave, the way in which the \\nbright red robes set off her soft turquoise skin.\\n\\nNevertheless, Lih had a reputation for coming down hard on those who brooked \\nImperial law; she was one of the few judges left who upheld the civil code without \\nwavering.\\n\\n“I have heard of you, Professor Seldon, and your theories about our imminent \\ndestruction. And I have spoken with the magistrate who recently heard another case in \\nwhich you were involved, one in which you struck a man with your lead-filled cane. In \\nthat instance, too, you claimed to be the victim of assault. Your reasoning stemmed, I \\nbelieve, from a previous unreported incident in which you and your son allegedly were \\nassaulted byeight hoodlums. You were able to convince my esteemed colleague, \\nProfessor Seldon of your plea of self-defense, even though an eyewitness testified \\notherwise. This time, Professor, you will have to be much more convincing.”\\n\\nThe three hoodlums who were bringing charges against Seldon and Palver snickered in \\ntheir seats at the plaintiff’s table. They presented a much different appearance today than \\nthey had the evening of the attack. The young men were sporting clean loose-fitting \\nunisuits; the young lady was wearing a crisply pleated tunic. All in all, if one didn’t look \\n(or listen) too closely, the three presented a reassuring picture of Trantorian youth.\\n\\nSeldon’s lawyer, Civ Novker (who was representing Palver as well), approached the \\nbench. “Your Honor, my client is an upstanding member of the Trantorian community. \\nHe is a former First Minister of stellar repute. He is a personal acquaintance of our \\nEmperor Agis XIV. What possible benefit could Professor Seldon derive from attacking \\ninnocent young people? He is one of the most vocal proponents of stimulating the \\nintellectual creativity of Trantorian youth--his Psychohistory Project employs numerous \\nstudent volunteers; he is a beloved member of the Streeling University faculty.\\n\\n“Further--” Here Novker paused, sweeping his gaze around the packed courtroom, as if \\nto say, Wait till you hear this--you’ll beashamed that you ever for a second doubted the \\nveracity of my client’s claims, “Professor Seldon is one of the very few private \\nindividuals officially allied with the prestigious Galactic Library. He has been granted \\nunlimited use of Library facilities for work on what he calls the Encyclopedia Galactica, \\na veritable paean to Imperial civilization.\\n\\n“I ask you, how can this man even be questioned in such a matter?”\\n\\nWith a flourish of his arm, Novker gestured toward Seldon who was sitting at the \\ndefendant’s table with Stettin Palver, looking decidedly uncomfortable. Hari’s cheeks \\n\\n',\n",
              " 'were flushed from the unaccustomed praise (after all, lately his name was the subject of \\nderisive snickers rather than flowery plaudits) and his hand shook slightly on the carved \\nDandle of his trusty cane.\\n\\nJudge Lih gazed down at Seldon clearly unimpressed. “What benefit, indeed, Counselor. \\nI have been asking myself that very question. I’ve lain make these past nights, racking \\nmy brains for a plausible reason. Why should a man of Professor Seldon’s stature \\ncommit unprovoked assault and battery when he himself is one of our most outspoken \\ncritics of the so-called ‘breakdown’ of civil order?\\n\\n“And then it dawned on me. Perhaps, in his frustration atnot being believed, Professor \\nSeldon feels he mustprove to the worlds that his predictions of doom and gloom really \\nare coming to pass. After all, here is a man who has spent his entire career foretelling the \\nFall of the Empire and all he can really point to are a few burned-out bulbs in the dome, \\nan occasional glitch in public transport, a budget cut here or there --nothing very \\ndramatic. But an attack--or two or three--now,that would be something.”\\n\\nLih sat back and folded her hands in front of her, a satisfied expression on her face. \\nSeldon stood, leaning heavily on the table for support. With great effort, he approached \\nthe bench, waving off his lawyer, walking headlong into the steely gaze of the judge.\\n\\n“Your Honor, please permit me to say a few words in my defense.”\\n\\n“Of course, Professor Seldon. After all, this is not a trial, only a hearing to air all \\nallegations, facts, and theories pertinent to the case before deciding whether or not to go \\nahead with a trial. I have merely expressed a theory; I am most interested to hear what \\nyou have to say.”\\n\\nSeldon cleared his throat before beginning. “I have devoted my life to the Empire. I have \\nfaithfully served the Emperors. My science of psychohistory, rather than being a \\nharbinger of destruction, is intended to be used as an agent for rejuvenation. With it we \\ncan beprepared for whatever course civilization takes. If, as I believe, the Empire \\ncontinues to break down, psychohistory will help us put into place building blocks for a \\nnew and better civilization founded on all that is good from the old. I love our worlds, \\nour peoples, ourEmpire --what would it behoove me to contribute to the lawlessness that \\nsaps its strength daily?\\n\\n“I can say no more. You must believe me. I, a man of intellect, of equations, of science--\\nI am speaking from my heart.” Seldon turned and made his way slowly back to his chair \\nbeside Palver. Before sitting, his eyes sought Wanda, sitting in the spectators’ gallery. \\nShe smiled wanly and winked at him.\\n\\n',\n",
              " '“From the heart or not, Professor Seldon, this decision will require much thought on my \\npart. We have heard from your accusers; we have heard from you and Mr. Palver. There \\nis one more party whose testimony I need. I’d like to hear from Rial Nevas, who has \\ncome forward as an eyewitness to this incident.”\\n\\nAs Nevas approached the bench, Seldon and Palver looked at each other in alarm. It was \\nthe boy whom Hari had admonished just before the attack.\\n\\nLih was asking the youth a question. “Would you describe, Mr. Nevas, exactly what you \\nwitnessed on the night in question?”\\n\\n“Well,” started Nevas, fixing Seldon with his sullen stare, “I was walkin’ along, mindin’ \\nmy own business, when I saw those two,”--he turned and pointed at Seldon and \\nPalver--”on the other side of the walkway, comin’ toward me. And then I saw those three \\nkids.” (Another point of the finger, this time toward the three sitting at the plaintiff’s \\ntable.) “The two older guys were walkin’ behind the kids. They didn’t see me, though, \\non account of I was on the other side of the walkway and besides, they were \\nconcentratin’ on their victims. Thenwham ! Just like that, that old guy swings at ‘em \\nwith his stick, then the younger guy jumps ‘em and kicks ‘em and before you know it, \\nthey’re all down on the ground. Then the old guy and his pal, they just took off, just like \\nthat. I couldn’t believe it.”\\n\\n“That’s a lie!” Seldon exploded. “Young man, you’re playing with our lives here!” \\nNevas only stared back at Seldon impassively.\\n\\n“Judge,” Seldon implored, “can’t you see that he is lying? I remember this fellow. I \\nscolded him for littering just minutes before we were attacked. I pointed it out to Stettin \\nas another instance of the breakdown of our society, the apathy of the citizenry, the--”\\n\\n“Enough, Professor Seldon,” commanded the judge. “Another outburst like that and I \\nwill have you ejected from this courtroom. Now, Mr. Nevas,” she said, turning back to \\nthe witness. “What did you do throughout the sequence of events you just described?”\\n\\n“I, uh, I hid. Behind some trees. I hid. I was afraid they’d come after me if they saw me, \\nso I hid. And when they were gone, well, I ran and called the security officers.”\\n\\nNevas had started to sweat and he inserted a finger into the constricting collar of his \\nunisuit. He fidgeted, shifting his weight from one foot to the other as he stood on the \\nraised speaker’s platform. He was uncomfortably aware of the crowd’s eyes upon him; \\nhe tried to avoid looking into the audience, but each time he did, he found himself drawn \\nto the steady gaze of a pretty blond girl sitting in the first row. It was as if she was \\nasking him a question, pressing him for an answer, willing him to speak.\\n\\n',\n",
              " '“Mr. Nevas, what do you have to say about Professor Seldon’s allegation that he and Mr. \\nPalver did see you prior to the attack, that the professor actually exchanged words with \\nyou?”\\n\\n“Well, uh, no, you see, it was just like I said . . . I was walkin’ along and--’ And now \\nNevas looked over at Seldon’s table. Seldon looked at the young man sadly, as if he \\nrealized all was lost. But Seldon’s companion, Stettin Palver, turned a fierce gaze on \\nNevas and Nevas jumped, startled, at the words he heard:Tell the truth! It was as if \\nPalver had spoken, but Palver’s lips hadn’t moved. And then, confused, Nevas snapped \\nhis head in the direction of the blond girl; he thought he heard her speak--Tell the \\ntruth!--but her lips were still as well.\\n\\n“Mr. Nevas, Mr. Nevas,” the judge’s voice broke in on the youth’s jumbled thoughts. \\n“Mr. Nevas, if Professor Seldon and Mr. Palver were walkingtoward you,behind the \\nthree plaintiffs, how is it that you noticed Seldon and Palverfirst ? That is how you put it \\nin your statement, is it not?”\\n\\nNevas glanced around the courtroom wildly. He couldn’t seem to escape the eyes, all the \\neyes screaming at him toTell the truth! Looking over at Hari Seldon, Rial Nevas said \\nsimply, “I’m sorry” and, to the amazement of the entire courtroom assemblage, the \\nfourteen-year-old boy started to cry.\\n\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\n 27\\n\\n      It was a lovely day, neither too warm nor too cold, not too bright nor too gray. Even \\nthough the groundskeeping budget had given out years ago, the few straggly perennials \\nlining the steps leading up to the Galactic Library managed to add a cheerful note to the \\nmorning. (The Library, having been built in the classical style of antiquity, was fronted \\nwith one of the grandest stairways to be found in the entire Empire, second only to the \\nsteps at the Imperial Palace itself. Most Library visitors, however, preferred to enter via \\nthe gliderail) Seldon had high hopes for the day.\\n\\nSince he and Stettin Palver had been cleared of all charges in their recent assault and \\nbattery case, Hari Seldon felt like a new man. Although the experience had been painful, \\nits very public nature had advanced Seldon’s cause. Judge Tejan Popjens Lih, who was \\nconsidered one of, if notthe most influential judge on Trantor, had been quite vociferous \\nin her opinion, delivered the day following Rial Nevas’s emotional testimony.\\n\\n',\n",
              " '“When we come to such a crossroads in our ‘civilized’ society,” the judge intoned from \\nher bench, “that a man of Professor Hari Seldon’s standing is made to bear the \\nhumiliation, abuse, and lies of his peers simply because of who he is and what he stands \\nfor, it is truly a dark day for the Empire. I admit that I, too, was taken in--at first. \\n‘Whywouldn’t Professor Seldon,’ I reasoned, ‘resort to such trickery in an attempt to \\nprove his predictions?’ But, as I came to see, I was most grievously wrong.” Here the \\njudge’s brow furrowed, a dark blue flush began creeping up her neck and into her \\ncheeks. “For I was ascribing to Professor Seldon motives born of our new society, a \\nsociety in which honesty, decency, and goodwill are likely to get one killed, a society in \\nwhich it appears one must resort to dishonesty and trickery merely to survive.\\n\\n“How far we have strayed from our founding principles. We were lucky this time, fellow \\ncitizens of Trantor. We owe a debt of thanks to Professor Hari Seldon for showing us our \\ntrue selves; let us take his example to heart and resolve to be vigilant against the baser \\nforces of our human nature.”\\n\\nFollowing the hearing, the Emperor had sent Seldon a congratulatory holo-disc. On it he \\nexpressed the hope that perhaps now Seldon would find renewed funding for his Project.\\n\\nAs Seldon slid up the entrance gliderail, he reflected on the current status of his \\nPsychohistory Project. His good friend--the former Chief Librarian Las Zenow--had \\nretired. During his tenure, Zenow had been a strong proponent of Seldon and his work. \\nMore often than not, however, Zenow’s hands had been tied by the Library Board. But, \\nhe had assured Seldon, the affable new Chief Librarian, Tryma Acarnio, was as \\nprogressive as he himself, and was popular with many factions among the Board \\nmembership.\\n\\n“Hari, my friend,” Zenow had said before leaving Trantor for his home world of \\nWencory, “Acarnio is a good man, a person of deep intellect and an open mind. I’m sure \\nhe’ll do all that he can to help you and the Project. I’ve left him the entire data file on \\nyou and your Encyclopedia; I know he’ll be as excited as I about the contribution to \\nhumanity it represents. Take care, my friend--I’ll remember you fondly.”\\n\\nAnd so today Hari Seldon was to have his first official meeting with the new Chief \\nLibrarian. He was cheered by the reassurances Las Zenow had left with him and he was \\nlooking forward to sharing his plans for the future of the Project and the Encyclopedia.\\n\\nTryma Acarnio stood as Hari entered the Chief Librarian’s office.\\n\\nAlready he had made his mark on the place; whereas Zenow had stuffed every nook and \\ncranny of the room with holo-discs and tridijournals from the different sectors of \\n\\n',\n",
              " 'Trantor, and a dizzying array of visiglobes representing various worlds of the Empire \\nhad spun in midair, Acarnio had swept clear the mounds of data and images that Zenow \\nhad liked to keep at his fingertips. A large holoscreen now dominated one wall on which, \\nSeldon presumed, Acarnio could view any publication or broadcast that he desired.\\n\\nAcarnio was short and stocky, with a slightly distracted look--from a childhood corneal \\ncorrection that had gone awry--that belied a fearsome intelligence and constant \\nawareness of everything going on around him at all times.\\n\\n“Well, well. Professor Seldon. Come in. Sit down.” Acarnio gestured to a straight-\\nbacked chair facing the desk at which he sat. “It was, I felt, quite fortuitous that you \\nrequested this meeting. You see, I had intended to get in touch with you as soon as I \\nsettled in.”\\n\\nSeldon nodded, pleased that the new Chief Librarian had considered him enough of a \\npriority to plan to seek him out in the hectic early days of his tenure.\\n\\n“But, first, Professor, please let me know why you wanted to see me before we move on \\nto my, most likely, more prosaic concerns.”\\n\\nSeldon cleared his throat and leaned forward. “Chief Librarian, Las Zenow has no doubt \\ntold you of my work here and of my idea for an Encyclopedia Galactica. Las was quite \\nenthusiastic, and a great help, providing a private office for me here and unlimited \\naccess to the Library’s vast resources. In fact, it was he who located the eventual home \\nof the Encyclopedia Project, a remote Outer World called Terminus.\\n\\n“There was one thing, however, that Las could not provide. In order to keep the Project \\non schedule, I must have office space and unlimited access granted to a number of my \\ncolleagues, as well. It is an enormous undertaking, just gathering the information to be \\ncopied and transferred to Terminus before we can begin the actual work of compiling the \\nEncyclopedia.\\n\\n“Las was not popular with the Library Board, as you undoubtedly are aware. You, \\nhowever, are. And so I ask you, Chief Librarian: Will you see to it that my colleagues \\nare granted insiders’ privileges so that we may continue our most vital work?”\\n\\nHere Hari stopped, almost out of breath. He was sure that his speech, which he had gone \\nover and over in his mind the night before, would have the desired effect. He waited, \\nconfident in Acarnio’s response.\\n\\n“Professor Seldon,” Acarnio began. Seldon’s expectant smile faded. There was an edge \\nto the Chief Librarian’s voice that Seldon had not expected. “My esteemed predecessor \\n\\n',\n",
              " 'provided me--in exhaustive detail --an explication of your work here at the Library. He \\nwas quite enthusiastic about your research and committed to the idea of your colleagues \\njoining you here. As was I, Professor Seldon”--at Acarnio’s pause, Seldon looked up \\nsharply--”at first. I was prepared to call a special meeting of the Board to propose that a \\nlarger suite of offices be prepared for you and your Encyclopedists. But, Professor \\nSeldon, all that has now changed.”\\n\\n“Changed! But why?”\\n\\n“Professor Seldon, you have just finished serving as principal defendant in a most \\nsensational assault and battery case.”\\n\\n“But I was acquitted,” Seldon broke in. “The case never even made it to trial.”\\n\\n“Nonetheless, Professor, your latest foray into the public eye has given you an \\nundeniable--how shall I say it?--tingeof ill repute. Oh yes, you were acquitted of all \\ncharges. But in order to get to that acquittal, your name, your past, your beliefs, and your \\nwork were paraded before the eyes of all the worlds. And even if one progressive right-\\nthinking judge has proclaimed you faultless, what of the millions--perhaps billions--of \\nother average citizens who see not a pioneering psychohistorian striving to preserve his \\ncivilization’s glory but a raving lunatic shouting doom and gloom for the great and \\nmighty Empire?\\n\\n“You, by the very nature of your work, are threatening the essential fabric of the Empire. \\nI don’t mean the huge, nameless, faceless, monolithic Empire. No, I am referring to the \\nheart and soul of the Empire--its people. When you tell them the Empire is failing, you \\nare saying thatthey are failing. And this, my dear Professor, the average citizen cannot \\nface.\\n\\n“Seldon, like it or not, you have become an object of derision, a subject of ridicule, a \\nlaughingstock.”\\n\\n“Pardon me, Chief Librarian, but for years now I have been, to some circles, a \\nlaughingstock.”\\n\\n“Yes, but only to some circles. But this latest incident--and the very public forum in \\nwhich it was played out--has opened you up to ridicule not only here on Trantor but \\nthroughout the worlds. And, Professor, if, by providing you an office, we, the Galactic \\nLibrary, give tacit approval to your work, then, by inference, we, the Library, also \\nbecome a laughingstock throughout the worlds. And no matter how strongly I \\nmaypersonally believe in your theory and your Encyclopedia, as Chief Librarian of the \\nGalactic Library on Trantor, I must think of the Library first.\\n\\n',\n",
              " '“And so, Professor Seldon, your request to bring in your colleagues is denied.”\\n\\nHari Seldon jerked back in his chair as if struck.\\n\\n“Further,” Acarnio continued, “I must advise you of a two-week temporary suspension \\nof all Library privileges--effective immediately. The Board has called that special \\nmeeting, Professor Seldon. In two weeks’ time we will notify you whether or not we’ve \\ndecided that our association with you must be terminated.”\\n\\nHere, Acarnio stopped speaking and, placing his palms on the glossy, spotless surface of \\nhis desk, stood up. “That is all, Professor Seldon--for now.”\\n\\nHari Seldon stood as well, although his upward movement was not as smooth, nor as \\nquick, as Tryma Acarnio’s..\\n\\n“May I be permitted to address the Board?” asked Seldon. “Perhaps if I were able to \\nexplain to them the vital importance of psychohistory and the Encyclopedia--”\\n\\n“I’m afraid not, Professor,” said Acarnio softly and Seldon caught a brief glimmer of the \\nman Las Zenow had told him about. But, just as quickly, the icy bureaucrat was back as \\nAcarnio guided Seldon to the door.\\n\\nAs the portals slid open, Acarnio said, “Two weeks, Professor Seldon. Till then.” Hari \\nstepped through to his waiting skitter and the doors slid shut.\\n\\nWhat am I going to do now? wondered Seldon disconsolately. Is this the end of my \\nwork?\\n\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\n 28\\n\\n      “Wanda dear, what is it that has you so engrossed?” asked Hari Seldon as he entered \\nhis granddaughter’s office at Streeling University. The room had been the office of the \\nbrilliant mathematician Yugo Amaryl, whose death had impoverished the Psychohistory \\nProject. Fortunately,\\n\\nWanda had gradually taken over Yugo’s role in recent years, further refining and \\nadjusting the Prime Radiant.\\n\\n',\n",
              " '“Why, I’m working on an equation in Section 33A2D17. See, I’ve recalibrated this \\nsection”--she gestured to a glowing violet patch suspended in midair in front of her \\nface-- ‘taking into consideration the standard quotient and-- There! Just what I thought--\\nI think.” She stepped back and rubbed her eyes.\\n\\n“What is it, Wanda?” Hari moved in closer to study the equation. “Why, this looks like \\nthe Terminus equation and yet . . . Wanda, this is aninverse of the Terminus equation, \\nisn’t it?”\\n\\n“Yes, Grandpa. See, the numbers weren’t working quite right in the Terminus equation--\\nlook.” Wanda touched a contact in a recessed wallstrip and another patch sprang to life \\nin vivid red on the other side of the room. Seldon and Wanda walked over to inspect it. \\n“You see how it’s all hanging together fine now, Grandpa? It’s taken me weeks to get it \\nthis way.”\\n\\n“How did you do it?” asked Hari, admiring the equation’s lines, its logic, its elegance.\\n\\n“At first, I concentrated on it from over here only. I blocked out all else. In order to get \\nTerminus to work, work on Terminus--stands to reason, doesn’t it? But then I realized \\nthat I couldn’t just introduce this equation into the Prime Radiant system and expect it to \\nblend right in smoothly, as if nothing happened. A placement means a displacement \\nsomewhere else. A weight needs a counterweight.”\\n\\n“I think the concept to which you are referring is what the ancients called ‘yinandyang .’ \\n“\\n\\n“Yes, more or less.Yin andyang . So, you see, I realized that to perfect theyin of \\nTerminus, I had to locate itsyang . Which I did, over there.” She moved back to the \\nviolet patch, tucked away at the other edge of the Prime Radiant sphere. “And once I \\nadjusted the figures here, the Terminus equation fell into place as well. Harmony!” \\nWanda looked pleased with herself, as if she’d solved all the problems of the Empire.\\n\\n“Fascinating, Wanda, and later on you must tell me what you think it all means for the \\nProject. --but right now you must come with me to the holoscreen. I received an urgent \\nmessage from Santanni a few minutes ago. Your father wants us to call him \\nimmediately.”\\n\\nWanda’s smile faded. She had been alarmed at the recent reports of fighting on Santanni. \\nAs Imperial budget cutbacks went into effect, the citizens of the Outer Worlds suffered \\nmost. They had limited access to the richer, more populous Inner Worlds and it became \\nmore and more difficult to trade their worlds’ products for much needed imports. \\n\\n',\n",
              " 'Imperial hyperships going in and out of Santanni were few and the distant world felt \\nisolated from the rest of the Empire. Pockets of rebellion had erupted throughout the \\nplanet.\\n\\n“Grandfather, I hope everything’s all right,” said Wanda, her fear revealed by her voice.\\n\\n“Don’t worry, dear. After all, they must be safe if Raych was able to send us a message.”\\n\\nIn Seldon’s office, he and Wanda stood before the holoscreen as it activated. Seldon \\npunched a code on the keypad alongside the screen and they waited a few seconds for \\nthe intragalactic connection to be established. Slowly the screen seemed to stretch back \\ninto the wall, as if it were the entrance to a tunnel--and out of the tunnel, dimly at first, \\ncame the familiar figure of a stocky powerfully built man. As the connection sharpened, \\nthe man’s features became clearer. When Seldon and Wanda were able to make out \\nRaych’s bushy Dahlite mustache, the figure sprang to life.\\n\\n“Dad! Wanda!” said Raych’s three-dimensional hologram, projected to Trantor from \\nSantanni. “Listen, I don’t have much time.” He flinched, as if startled by a loud noise. \\n“Things have gotten pretty bad here. The government has fallen and a provisional party \\nhas taken over. Things are a mess, as you can imagine. I just put Manella and Bellis on a \\nhypership to Anacreon. I told them to get in touch with you from there. The name of the \\nship is theArcadia VII .\\n\\n“You should have seen Manella, Dad. Mad as anything that she had to go. The only way \\nI was able to convince her to leave was to point out that it was for Bellis’s sake.\\n\\n“I know what you’re thinking, Dad and Wanda. Of course I would have gone with \\nthem--if I could have. But there wasn’t enough room. You should’ve seen what I had to \\ngo through just to getthem onto the ship.” Raych flashed one of his lopsided grins that \\nSeldon and Wanda loved so much, then continued. “Besides, since I’m here, I have to \\nhelp guard the University--we may be part of theImperial University system, but we’re a \\nplace of learning and building, not of destruction. I tell you, if one of those hot-headed \\nSantanni rebels comes near our stuff--”\\n\\n“Raych,” Hari broke in, “How bad is it? Are you close to the fighting?”\\n\\n“Dad, are you in danger?” asked Wanda.\\n\\nThey waited a few seconds for their message to travel the nine thousand parsecs across \\nthe Galaxy to Raych.\\n\\n“I--I--I couldn’t quite make out what you said,” the hologram replied. “There’s a bit of \\n\\n',\n",
              " 'fighting going on. It’s sort of exciting, actually,” Raych said, breaking into that grin \\nagain. “So I’m going to sign off now.

The holoscreen tunnel collapsed in on \\nitself so that Seldon and Wanda were left staring at a blank wall.\\n\\n“Grandpa,” said Wanda, “what do you think he was going to say?”\\n\\n“I have no idea, dear. But there is one thing I do know and that is that your father can \\ntake care of himself. I pity any rebel who gets near enough for a well-placed Twist-kick \\nfrom your dad! --Come, let’s get back to that equation and in a few hours we’ll check on \\ntheArcadia VII .”\\n\\n  \\n\\n“Commander, have you no idea what happened to the ship?” Hari Seldon was again \\nengaged in intragalactic conversation, but this time it was with an Imperial navy \\ncommander stationed at Anacreon. For this communication, Seldon was making use of \\nthe visiscreen--much less realistic than the holoscreen but also much simpler.\\n\\n“I’m telling you, Professor, that we have no record of that hypership requesting \\npermission to enter the Anacreonic atmosphere. Of course, communications with \\nSantanni have been broken for several hours and sporadic at best for the last week. It is \\npossible that the ship tried to reach us on a Santanni-based channel and could not get \\nthrough, but I doubt it.\\n\\n“No, it’s more likely that theArcadia VII changed destination. Voreg, perhaps, or Sarip. \\nHave you tried either of those worlds, Professor?”\\n\\n“No,” said Seldon wearily, “but I see no reason if the ship was bound for Anacreon that \\nit would not go to Anacreon. Commander, it is vital that I locate that ship.”\\n\\n“Of course,” the commander ventured, “theArcadia VII might not have made it. Out \\nsafely, I mean. There’s a lot of fighting going on. Those rebels don’t care who they blow \\nup. They just train their lasers and pretend it’s the Emperor Agis they’re blasting. I tell \\nyou, it’s a whole different game out here on the fringe, Professor.”\\n\\n“My daughter-in-law and granddaughter are on that ship, Commander,” Seldon said in a \\ntight voice.\\n\\n“Oh, I’m sorry, Professor,” said an abashed commander. “I’ll be in touch with you as \\nsoon as I hear anything.”\\n\\n',\n",
              " 'Dispiritedly Hari closed the visiscreen contact. How tired I am, he thought. And, he \\nmused, I’m not surprised--I’ve known that this would come for nearly forty years.\\n\\nSeldon chuckled bitterly to himself. Perhaps that commander had thought he was \\nshocking Seldon, impressing him with the vivid detail of life “on the fringe.” But Seldon \\nknew all about the fringe. And as the fringe came apart, like a piece of knitting with one \\nloose thread, the whole piece would unravel to the core: Trantor.\\n\\nSeldon became aware of a soft buzzing sound. It was the door signal. “Yes?”\\n\\n“Grandpa,” said Wanda, entering the office, “I’m scared.”\\n\\n“Why, dear?” asked Seldon with concern. He didn’t want to tell her yet what he had \\nlearned--orhadn’t learned--from the commander on Anacreon.\\n\\n“Usually, although they’re so far away, Ifeel Dad and Mom and Bellis --feel them in \\nhere”--she pointed to her head-- ‘and in here”--she placed her hand over her heart. “But \\nnow, today, I don’t feel them--it feels less, as if they’re fading, like one of the dome \\nbulbs. And I want to stop it. I want to pull them back, but I can’t.”\\n\\n“Wanda, I really think this is merely a product of your concern for your family in light \\nof the rebellion. You know that uprisings occur all over the Empire all the time--little \\neruptions to let off steam. Come now, you know that chances of anything happening to \\nRaych, Manella, or Bellis are vanishingly small. Your dad will call any day to say all is \\nwell; your mom and Bellis will land on Anacreon at any moment and enjoy a little \\nvacation. We are the ones to be pitied--we’re stuck here up to our ears in work! So, \\nsweetheart, go to bed and think only good thoughts. I promise you, tomorrow, under the \\nsunny dome, things will look much better.”\\n\\n“All right, Grandpa,” said Wanda, not sounding entirely convinced. “But tomorrow--if \\nwe haven’t heard by tomorrow--we’ll have to--to--”\\n\\n“Wanda, what can we do, except wait?” asked Hari, his voice gentle.\\n\\nWanda turned and left, the weight of her worries showing in the slope of her shoulders. \\nHari watched her go, finally allowing his own worries to come to the surface.\\n\\nIt had been three days since the hologram transmission from Raych. Since then--nothing. \\nAnd today the naval commander at Anacreon denied ever having heard of a ship \\ncalledArcadia VII .\\n\\n',\n",
              " 'Hari had tried earlier to get through to Raych on Santanni, but all communication beams \\nwere down. It was as if Santanni--and theArcadia VII --had simply broken off from the \\nEmpire, like a petal from a flower.\\n\\nSeldon knew what he had to do now. The Empire might be down, but it was not out. Its \\npower, when properly wielded, was still awesome. Seldon placed an emergency \\ntransmission to Emperor Agis XIV.\\n\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\n 29\\n\\n      “What a surprise--my friend Hari!” Agis’s visage beamed at Seldon through the \\nholoscreen. “I am glad to hear from you, although you usually request the more formal \\npersonal audience. Come, you’ve piqued my interest. Why the urgency?”\\n\\n“Sire,” began Seldon, “my son, Raych, and his wife and daughter live on Santanni.”\\n\\n“Ah, Santanni,” the Emperor said as his smile faded. “A bunch of misguided wretches if \\nI ever--”\\n\\n“Sire, please,” broke in Seldon, surprising both the Emperor and himself with this \\nflagrant breach of Imperial protocol. “My son was able to get Manella and Bellis onto a \\nhypership, theArcadia VII , bound for Anacreon. He, however, had to remain. That was \\nthree days ago. The ship has not landed at Anacreon. And my son seems to have \\ndisappeared. My calls to Santanni have gone unanswered and now the communication \\nbeams are broken.\\n\\n“Please, Sire, can you help me?”\\n\\n“Hari, as you know, officially all ties between Santanni and Trantor have been severed. \\nHowever, I still hold some influence in selected areas of Santanni. That is, there are still \\na few loyal to me who have not yet been found out. Although I cannot make direct \\ncontact with any of my operatives on that world, I can share with you any reports I \\nreceive from there. These are, of course, highly confidential, but considering your \\nsituation and our relationship, I will allow you access to those pieces that might interest \\nyou.\\n\\n“I am expecting another dispatch within the hour. If you like, I’ll recontact you when it \\narrives. In the meantime, I’ll have one of my aides go over all transmissions from \\n\\n',\n",

I thank you most humbly.” And Hari Seldon dipped his head as the \\nEmperor’s image faded from the holoscreen.\\n\\nSixty minutes later Hari Seldon was still sitting at his desk, waiting to hear from the \\nEmperor. The past hour had been one of the most difficult he had ever spent, second \\nonly to the hours after Dors’s destruction.\\n\\nIt was the not knowing that did Hari in. He had made a career ofknowing --the future as \\nwell as the present. And now he had no idea at all about three of the people most \\nprecious to him.\\n\\nThe holoscreen buzzed softly and Hari pressed a contact in response. Agis appeared.\\n\\n“Hari,” began the Emperor. From the soft slow sadness in his voice, Hari knew this call \\nbrought bad news.\\n\\n“My son,” said Hari.\\n\\n“Yes,” replied the Emperor. “Raych was killed, earlier today, in a bombardment on \\nSantanni University. I’ve learned from my sources that Raych knew the attack was \\ncoming but refused to desert his post. You see, a good number of the rebels are students \\nand Raych felt that if they knew that he was still there, they would never. . . But hate \\novercame all reason.\\n\\n“The University is, you see, anImperial University. The rebels feel they must destroy all \\nthings Imperial before rebuilding anew. The fools! Why--” And here Agis stopped, as if \\nsuddenly realizing that Seldon did not care about Santanni University or the plans of the \\nrebels--not right now, at least.\\n\\n“Hari, if it makes you feel any better, remember that your son died in defense of \\nknowledge. It was not the Empire Raych fought and died for but humanity itself.”\\n\\nSeldon looked up out of tear-filled eyes. Weakly he asked, “And Manella and little \\nBellis? What of them? Have you found theArcadia VII ?”\\n\\n“That search has proved fruitless, Hari. TheArcadia VII left Santanni, as you were told. \\nBut it seems to have disappeared. It may have been hijacked by rebels or it may have \\nmade an emergency detour--at this point, we just don’t know.”\\n\\n',\n",
              " 'Seldon nodded. “Thank you, Agis. Although you have brought me tragic news, at least \\nyou have brought it. Not knowing was worse. You are a true friend.”\\n\\n“And so, my friend,” said the Emperor, “I’ll leave you to yourself now--and your \\nmemories.” The Emperor’s image faded from the screen as Hari Seldon folded his arms \\nin front of him on his desk, put his head down, and wept.\\n\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\n 30\\n\\n      Wanda Seldon adjusted the waistband of her unisuit, pulling it a little tighter around \\nher middle. Taking up a hand hoe, she attacked some weeds that had sprung up in her \\nsmall flower garden outside the Psychohistory Building at Streeling. Generally Wanda \\nspent the bulk of her time in her office, working with her Prime Radiant. She found \\nsolace in its precise statistical elegance; the unvarying equations were somehow \\nreassuring in this Empire gone so crazy. But when thoughts of her beloved father, \\nmother, and baby sister became too much to bear, when even her research could not keep \\nher mind off the horrible losses she’d so recently undergone, Wanda invariably found \\nherself out here, scratching at the terraformed ground, as if coaxing a few plants to life \\nmight somehow, in some tiny measure, ameliorate her pain.\\n\\nSince her father’s death a month ago and the disappearance of Manella and Bellis, \\nWanda, who had always been slim, had been losing weight. Whereas a few months ago \\nHari Seldon would have been concerned over his darling granddaughter’s loss of \\nappetite, now he, stuck in his own grief, seemed not to notice.\\n\\nA profound change had come over Hari and Wanda Seldon--and the few remaining \\nmembers of the Psychohistory Project. Hari seemed to have given up. He now spent \\nmost of his days sitting in an armchair in the Streeling solarium, staring out at the \\nUniversity grounds, warmed by the bright bulbs overhead. Occasionally Project \\nmembers told Wanda that his bodyguard, a man named Stettin Palver, would badger \\nSeldon into a walk out under the dome or try to engage him in a discussion of the future \\ndirection of the Project.\\n\\nWanda retreated deeper into her study of the Prime Radiant’s fascinating equations. She \\ncould feel the future her grandfather had worked so hard to achieve finally taking shape, \\nand he was right: The Encyclopedists must be established on Terminus; they would be \\nthe Foundation.\\n\\n',\n",
              " 'And Section 33A2D17--in it Wanda could see what Seldon referred to as the Second, or \\nsecret, Foundation. But how? Without Seldon’s active interest, Wanda was at a loss as to \\nhow to proceed. And her sorrow over the destruction of her family cut so deep that she \\ndidn’t seem to have the strength to figure it out.\\n\\nThe members of the Project itself, those fifty or so hardy souls who remained, continued \\ntheir work as well as possible. The majority were Encyclopedists, researching the source \\nmaterials they would need to copy and catalogue for their eventual move to Terminus--\\nwhen and if they gained full access to the Galactic Library. At this point, they were \\nworking on faith alone. Professor Seldon had lost his private office at the Library, so the \\nprospects of any other Project member gaining special access were slim.\\n\\nThe remaining Project members (other than the Encyclopedists) were historical analysts \\nand mathematicians. The historians interpreted past and current human actions and \\nevents, turning their findings over to the mathematicians, who in turn fit those pieces \\ninto the great Psychohistorical Equation. It was long painstaking work.\\n\\nMany Project members had left because the rewards were so few--psychohistorians were \\nthe butt of many jokes on Trantor and limited funds had forced Seldon to enact drastic \\npay cuts. But the constant reassuring presence of Hari Seldon had--till now--overcome \\nthe difficult working conditions of the Project. Indeed, the Project members who had \\nstayed on had, to a person, done so out of respect and devotion to Professor Seldon.\\n\\nNow, thought Wanda Seldon bitterly, what reason is left for them to stay? A light breeze \\nblew a piece of her blond hair across her eyes; she pushed it back absentmindedly and \\ncontinued her weeding.\\n\\n“Miss Seldon, may I have a moment of your time?” Wanda turned and looked up. A \\nyoung man--she judged him to be in his early twenties --stood on the gravel path next to \\nher. She immediately sensed him to be strong and fearsomely intelligent. Her \\ngrandfather had chosen wisely. Wanda rose to speak with him.\\n\\n“I recognize you. You are my grandfather’s bodyguard, are you not? Stettin Palver, I \\nbelieve?”\\n\\n“Yes, that’s correct, Miss Seldon,” Palver said and his cheeks reddened slightly, as if he \\nwere pleased that so pretty a girl should have given him any notice. “Miss Seldon, it is \\nyour grandfather I’d like to talk to you about. I’m very worried about him. We must do \\nsomething.”\\n\\n“Do what, Mr. Palver? I am at a loss. Since my father”--she swallowed hard, as if she \\nwere having difficulty speaking--”died and my mother and sister disappeared, it is all I \\n\\n',\n",
              " 'can do to get him out of bed in the morning. And to tell you the truth, it has affected me \\nvery deeply as well. You understand, don’t you?” She looked into his eyes and knew that \\nhe did.\\n\\n“Miss Seldon,” Palver said softly, “I am terribly sorry about your losses. But you and \\nProfessor Seldon arealive and you must keep working at psychohistory. The professor \\nseems to have given up. I was hoping that maybe you--we--could come up with \\nsomething to give him hope again. You know, a reason to go on.”\\n\\nAh, Mr. Palver, thought Wanda,maybe Grandpa has it right. I wonder if there truly is any \\nreason to go on . But she said, “I’m sorry, Mr. Palver, I can think of nothing.” She \\ngestured toward the ground with her hoe. “And now, as you can see, I must get back to \\nthese pesky weeds.”\\n\\n“I don’t think your grandfather has got it right. I think there truly is a reason to go on. \\nWe just have to find it.”\\n\\nThe words struck her with full force. How had he known what she had been thinking? \\nUnless-- “You can handle minds, can’t you?” Wanda asked, holding her breath, as if \\nafraid to hear Palver’s response.\\n\\n“Yes, I can,” the young man replied. “I always have, I think. At least, I can’t \\nremembernot doing it. Half the time I’m not even consciously aware of it--I just know \\nwhat people are thinking--or have thought.\\n\\n“Sometimes,” he continued, encouraged by the understanding he felt emanating from \\nWanda, “I getflashes of it coming from someone else. It’s always in a crowd, though, \\nand I can’t locate whoever it is. But I know there are others like me--us--around.”\\n\\nWanda grabbed Palver’s hand excitedly, her gardening tool tossed to the ground, \\nforgotten. “Have you any idea what this might mean? For Grandpa, for psychohistory? \\nOne of us alone can do only so much, but both of us together--” Wanda started walking \\ninto the Psychohistory Building, leaving Palver standing on the gravel path. Almost to \\nthe entrance she stopped and turned.Come, Mr. Palver, we must tell my grandfather , \\nWanda said without opening her mouth.Yes, I suppose we should , answered Palver as \\nhe joined her.\\n\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\n 31\\n\\n',\n",
              " '      “Do you mean to say I have been searching Trantor-wide for someone with your \\npowers, Wanda, and he’s been here with us for the past few months and we never knew \\nit?” Hari Seldon was incredulous. He had been dozing in the solarium when Wanda and \\nPalver shook him awake to give him their amazing news.\\n\\n“Yes, Grandpa. Think about it. I’ve never had occasion to meet Stettin. Your time with \\nhim has primarily been away from the Project and I spend the majority of my time \\ncloseted in my office, working with the Prime Radiant. Whenwould we have met? In \\nfact, the one time our paths did cross, the results were most significant.”\\n\\n“When was that?” asked Seldon, searching his memory.\\n\\n“Your last hearing--before Judge Lih,” Wanda replied immediately. “Remember the \\neyewitness who swore that you and Stettin had attacked those three muggers? \\nRemember how he broke down and told the truth --and even he didn’t seem to know \\nwhy. But Stettin and I have pieced it together. We were both pushing Rial Nevas to come \\nclean. He had been very steadfast in his original claim; I doubt that either one of us \\nwould have been able to push him alone. Buttogether ”--she stole a shy glance at Palver, \\nwho was standing off to the side--”our power is awesome!”\\n\\nHari Seldon took all this in and then made as if to speak. But Wanda continued. “In fact, \\nwe plan to spend the afternoon testing our mentalic abilities, separately and together. \\nFrom the little we’ve discovered so far, it seems as if Stettin’s power is slightly lower \\nthan mine--perhaps a five on my rating scale. But his five, combined with my seven, \\ngives us a twelve! Think of it, Grandpa. Awesome!”\\n\\n“Don’t you see, Professor?” Palver spoke up. “Wanda and I are that breakthrough you’re \\nlooking for. We can help you convince the worlds of the validity of psychohistory, we \\ncan help find others like us, we can help put psychohistory back on track.”\\n\\nHari Seldon gazed up at the two young people standing in front of him. Their faces were \\naglow with youth and vigor and enthusiasm and he realized it did his old heart good. \\nPerhaps all was not lost, after all. He had not thought he would survive this latest \\ntragedy, the death of his son and the disappearance of his son’s wife and child, but now \\nhe could see that Raych lived on in Wanda. And in Wanda and Stettin, he now knew, \\nlived the future of the Foundation.\\n\\n“Yes, yes,” agreed Seldon nodding forcefully. “Come you two, help me up. I must get \\nback to my office to plan our next step.”\\n\\n  \\n\\n',\n",
              " ' 32\\n\\n  \\n\\n      “Professor Seldon come in,” said Chief Librarian Tryma Acarnio in an icy tone of \\nvoice. Hari Seldon accompanied by Wanda and Palver, entered the Chief Librarian’s \\nimposing office.\\n\\n“Thank you, Chief Librarian,” said Seldon as he settled into a chair and faced Acarnio \\nacross the vast desk. “May I introduce my granddaughter Wanda and my friend Stettin \\nPalver. Wanda is a most valuable member of the Psychohistory Project, her specialty \\nbeing in the field of mathematics. And Stettin, well, Stettin is turning into a first-rate \\ngeneral psychohistorian--when he’s not performing his duties as my bodyguard, that is.” \\nSeldon chuckled amiably.\\n\\n“Yes, well, that’s all well and good, Professor,” said Acarnio, baffled by Seldon’s good \\nhumor. He had expected the professor to come in groveling, begging for another chance \\nat special Library privileges.\\n\\n“But I don’t understand what it is you wanted to see me about. I assume you realize that \\nour position is firm: We cannot allow a Library association with someone so extremely \\nunpopular with the general population. We are, after all, apublic library and we must \\nkeep the public’s sentiments in mind.” Acarnio settled back--perhapsnow the groveling \\nwould begin.\\n\\n“I realize that I have not been able to sway you. However, I thought that if you heard \\nfrom a couple of the Project’s younger members--the psychohistorians of tomorrow, as it \\nwere--that perhaps you’d get a better feel about what a vital role the Project--and the \\nEncyclopedia, in particular--will play in our future. Please hear Wanda and Stettin out.”\\n\\nAcarnio cast a cold eye toward the two young people flanking Seldon. “Very well, then,” \\nhe said, pointedly eyeing the timestrip on the wall. “Five minutes and no more. I have a \\nLibrary to run.”\\n\\n“Chief Librarian,” began Wanda, “as my grandfather has undoubtedly explained to you, \\npsychohistory is a most valuable tool to be used for the preservation of our culture. \\nYes,preservation ,” she repeated, upon seeing Acarnio’s eyes widen at the word. “Undue \\nemphasis has been placed on the destruction of the Empire. By doing so, the true value \\nof psychohistory has been overlooked. For, with psychohistory, as we are able to predict \\nthe inevitable decline of our civilization, so are we able to take steps toward its \\npreservation. That is what the Encyclopedia Galactica is all about. And that is why we \\n\\n',\n",
              " 'need your help, and the help of your great Library.”\\n\\nAcarnio could not resist smiling. The young lady had an undeniable charm. She was so \\nearnest, so well spoken. He gazed at her sitting in front of him, her blond hair pulled \\nback in a rather severe scholarly style, one which could not hide her attractive features \\nbut, rather, showed them off. What she was saying was starting to make sense. Maybe \\nWanda Seldon was right--maybe he had been looking at this problem from the wrong \\nangle. If it were actually a matter ofpreservation , rather thandestruction . . .\\n\\n“Chief Librarian,” began Stettin Palver, “this great Library has stood for millennia. It, \\nperhaps even more than the Imperial Palace, represents the vast power of the Empire. \\nFor, the Palace houses only the Empire’s leader, while the Library is home to the sum \\ntotal of Imperial knowledge, culture, and history. Its value is incalculable.\\n\\n“Does it not make sense to prepare a tribute to this great repository? The Encyclopedia \\nGalactica will be just that--a giant summary of all the knowledge contained within these \\nvery walls. Think of it!”\\n\\nAll of a sudden it seemed so very clear to Acarnio. How could he have let the Board \\n(especially that sourpuss Gennaro Mummery) convince him to rescind Seldon’s \\nprivileges? Las Zenow, a person whose judgment he greatly esteemed, had been a \\nwholehearted supporter of Seldon’s Encyclopedia.\\n\\nHe glanced again at the three in front of him, waiting for his decision. The Board would \\nbe hard-pressed to find anything to complain about with the Project members--if the \\nyoung people now in his office were a representative sample of the kind of persons \\ninvolved with Seldon.\\n\\nAcarnio rose and walked across his office, his brow furrowed, as if framing his thoughts. \\nHe picked up a milky crystal sphere from a table and hefted it in his palm.\\n\\n“Trantor,” Acarnio began thoughtfully, “seat of the Empire, center of all the Galaxy. \\nQuite amazing, when you think of it. --We have, perhaps, been too quick to judge \\nProfessor Seldon. Now that your Project, this Encyclopedia Galactica, has been \\npresented to me in such a light”--he gave a brief nod to Wanda and Palver--”I realize \\nhow important it would be to allow you to continue your work here. And, of course, to \\ngrant access to a number of your colleagues.”\\n\\nSeldon smiled gratefully and squeezed Wanda’s hand.\\n\\n“It is not only for the greater glory of the Empire that I am recommending this,” \\ncontinued Acarnio, apparently warming to the idea (and the sound of his own voice). \\n\\n',\n",
              " '“You are famous, Professor Seldon. Whether people think of you as a crackpot or a \\ngenius,everyone seems to have an opinion. If an academic of your stature is allied with \\nthe Galactic Library, it can only increase our prestige as a bastion of intellectual pursuit \\nof the highest order. Why, the luster of your presence can be used to raise much-needed \\nfunds to update our collections, increase our staff, keep our doors open to the public \\nlonger . . .\\n\\n“And the prospect of the Encyclopedia Galactica itself-what a monumental project! \\nImagine the reaction when the public learns that the Galactic Library is involved with \\nsuch an undertaking designed to highlight the splendor of our civilization--our glorious \\nhistory, our brilliant achievements, our magnificent cultures. And to think that I, Chief \\nLibrarian Tryma Acarnio, is responsible for making sure that this great Project gets its \\nstart--” Acarnio gazed intently into the crystal sphere, lost in reverie.\\n\\n“Yes, Professor Seldon,” Acarnio pulled himself back to the here and now. “You and \\nyour colleagues will be granted full insiders’ privileges--and a suite of offices in which \\nto work.” He placed the crystal sphere back on its table and, with a swish of robes, \\nmoved back to his desk.\\n\\n“It might take a little doing, of course, to persuade the Board--but I am confident that I \\ncan handle them. Just leave it to me.”\\n\\nSeldon, Wanda, and Palver looked at each other in triumph, with small smiles playing at \\nthe corner of their mouths. Tryma Acarnio gestured that they could go and so they did, \\nleaving the Chief Librarian settled in his chair, dreaming of the glory and honor that \\nwould come to the Library under his aegis.\\n\\n“Amazing,” said Seldon when the three were safely ensconced in their ground-car. “If \\nyou could have seen him at our last meeting. He said I was ‘threatening the essential \\nfabric of our Empire’ or some such rot. And today, after just a few minutes with you \\ntwo--”\\n\\n“It wasn’t too hard, Grandpa,” Wanda said as she pressed a contact, moving the ground-\\ncar out into traffic. She sat back as the auto-propel took over; Wanda had punched their \\ndestination coordinates into the control panel. “He is a man with a strong sense of self-\\nimportance. All we had to do was play up the positive aspects of the Encyclopedia and \\nhis ego took over from there.”\\n\\n“He was a goner the minute Wanda and I walked in,” Palver said from the back. “With \\nboth of us pushing him, it was a piece of cake.” Palver reached forward and squeezed \\nWanda’s shoulder affectionately. She smiled, reached up, and patted his hand.\\n\\n',\n",
              " '“I must alert the Encyclopedists as soon as possible,” Seldon said. “Although there are \\nonly thirty-two left, they are good and dedicated workers. I’ll get them installed at the \\nLibrary and then I’ll tackle the next hurdle--credits. Perhaps this alliance with the \\nLibrary is what I need to convince people to give us funding. Let’s see-- I’ll call upon \\nTerep Bindris again and I’ll take you two with me. He was kindly disposed toward me, \\nat least at first. But how will he be able to resist us now?”\\n\\nThe ground-car eventually came to a halt outside the Psychohistory Building at \\nStreeling. The side panels slid open, but Seldon did not immediately move to disembark. \\nHe turned to face Wanda.\\n\\n“Wanda, you know what you and Stettin were able to accomplish with Acarnio; I’m sure \\nyou both can push some credits out of a few financial benefactors as well.\\n\\n“I know how you hate to leave your beloved Prime Radiant, but these visits will give \\nyou two a chance to practice, to hone your skills, to get an idea of just what you can do.”\\n\\n“All right, Grandpa, although I’m sure that, now that you have the Library’s imprimatur, \\nyou will find that resistance to your requests has lessened.”\\n\\n“There’s another reason I think it’s important for the two of you to get out and around \\ntogether. --Stettin, I believe you said that on certain occasions you’ve ‘felt’ another mind \\nlike yours but haven’t been able to identify it.”\\n\\n“Yes,” answered Palver, “I’ve had flashes, but each time I was in a crowd. And, in my \\ntwenty-four years, I can remember feeling such a flash just four or five times.”\\n\\n“But, Stettin,” said Seldon, his voice low with intensity, “each flash was, potentially, the \\nmind of another person like you and Wanda--another mentalic. Wanda’s never felt these \\nflashes because, frankly, she’s been sheltered all her life. The few times she’s been out in \\na crowd there must not have been any other mentalics around.\\n\\n“That’s one reason--perhaps the most important reason--for you two to get out--with me \\nor without me. We must find other mentalics. The two of you alone are strong enough to \\npush a single person. A large group of you, all pushing together, will have the power to \\nmove an Empire!”\\n\\nWith that. Hari Seldon swung his legs around and hoisted himself out of the ground-car. \\nAs Wanda and Palver watched him limp up the pathway to the Psychohistory Building, \\nthey were only dimly aware of the enormous responsibility Seldon had just placed on \\ntheir young shoulders.\\n\\n',\n",
              " '  \\n\\n  \\n\\n 33\\n\\n      It was midafternoon and the Trantorian sun glinted on the metal skin covering the \\ngreat planet. Hari Seldon stood at the edge of the Streeling University observation deck, \\nattempting to shield his eyes from the harsh glare with his hand. It had been years since \\nhe’d been out from under the dome, save for his few visits to the Palace, and somehow \\nthose didn’t count; one was still very muchenclosed on the Imperial grounds.\\n\\nSeldon no longer traveled around only if accompanied. In the first place, Palver spent \\nthe majority of his time with Wanda, either working on the Prime Radiant, absorbed in \\nmentalic research, or searching for others like them. But if he had wanted, Seldon could \\nhave found another young man--a University student or a Project member--to act as his \\nbodyguard.\\n\\nHowever, Seldon knew that a bodyguard was no longer necessary. Since the much \\npublicized hearing and the reestablishment of ties with the Galactic Library, the \\nCommission for Public Safety had taken a keen interest in Seldon. Seldon knew that he \\nwas being followed; he had caught sight of his “shadow” on a number of occasions in \\nthe past few months. He also had no doubt that his home and office had been infiltrated \\nby listening devices, but he himself activated a static shield whenever he engaged in \\nsensitive communications.\\n\\nSeldon was not sure what the Commission thought of him--perhaps they were not yet \\nsure themselves. Regardless of whether they believed him to be a prophet or a crackpot, \\nthey made it their business to know where he was at all times--and that meant that, until \\nthe Commission deemed otherwise, at all times Seldon was safe.\\n\\nA light breeze billowed the deep blue cloak Seldon had draped over his unisuit and \\nruffed the few wispy white hairs remaining on his head. He glanced down over the \\nrailing, taking in the seamless steel blanket below. Beneath that blanket, Seldon knew, \\nrumbled the machinery of a vastly complicated world. If the dome were transparent, one \\nwould see ground-cars racing, gravicabs swooshing through an intricate network of \\ninterconnecting tunnels, space hyperships being loaded and unloaded with grain and \\nchemicals and jewels bound for and from practically every world of the Empire.\\n\\nBelow the gleaming metal cover, the lives of forty billion people were being conducted, \\nwith all the attendant pain, joy, and drama of human life. It was an image he loved \\ndearly--this panorama of human achievement--and it pierced his heart to know that, in \\n\\n',\n",
              " 'just a few centuries, all that now lay before him would be in ruins. The great dome \\nwould be ripped and scarred, torn away to reveal the desolate wasteland of what was \\nonce the seat of a thriving civilization. He shook his head in sadness, for he knew there \\nwas nothing he could do to prevent that tragedy. But, as Seldon foresaw the ruined \\ndome, he also knew that from the ground laid bare by the last battles of the Empire \\nliving shoots would spring and somehow Trantor would reemerge as a vital member of \\nthe new Empire. The Plan saw to that.\\n\\nSeldon lowered himself onto one of the benches ringing the deck’s perimeter. His leg \\nwas throbbing painfully; the exertion of the trip had been a bit much. But it had been \\nworth it to gaze once again at Trantor, to feel the open air around him and see the vast \\nsky above.\\n\\nSeldon thought wistfully of Wanda. He rarely saw his granddaughter at all anymore and \\ninvariably Stettin Palver was present when he did. In the three months since Wanda and \\nPalver had met, they seemed to be inseparable. Wanda assured Seldon that the constant \\ninvolvement was necessary for the Project, but Seldon suspected it went deeper than \\nmere devotion to one’s job.\\n\\nHe remembered the telltale signs from his early days with Dors. It was there in the way \\nthe two young people looked at each other, with an intensity born not only of intellectual \\nstimulation but emotional motivation as well.\\n\\nFurther, by their very natures, Wanda and Palver seemed to be more comfortable with \\neach other than with other people. In fact, Seldon had discovered that when no one else \\nwas around, Wanda and Palver didn’t eventalk to each other; their mentalic abilities \\nwere sufficiently advanced that they had no need ofwords to communicate.\\n\\nThe other Project members were not aware of Wanda’s and Palver’s unique talents. \\nSeldon had felt it best to keep the mentalics’ work quiet, at least until their role in the \\nPlan was firmly defined. Actually the Plan itself was firmly defined--but solely in \\nSeldon’s mind. As a few more pieces fell into place, he would reveal his Plan to Wanda \\nand Palver and someday, of necessity, to one or two others.\\n\\nSeldon stood slowly, stiffly. He was due back at Streeling in an hour to meet Wanda and \\nPalver. They had left word for him that they were bringing a great surprise. Another \\npiece for the puzzle, Seldon hoped. He looked out one last time over Trantor and, before \\nturning to make his way back to the gravitic repulsion elevator, smiled and softly said, \\n“Foundation.”\\n\\n  \\n\\n',\n",
              " ' 34\\n\\n  \\n\\n      Hari Seldon entered his office to find that Wanda and Palver had already arrived and \\nwere seated around the conference table at the far end of the room. As was usual with \\nthose two, the room was completely silent.\\n\\nThen Seldon stopped short, noticing that a new fellow was sitting with them. How \\nstrange--out of politeness, Wanda and Palver usually reverted to standard speech when \\nin the company of other people, yet none of the three was speaking.\\n\\nSeldon studied the stranger--an odd-looking man, about thirty-five years old, with the \\nmyopic look of one caught up for too long in his studies. If it weren’t for a certain \\ndetermined set to the stranger’s jaw, Seldon thought he might be dismissed as \\nineffectual, but that would obviously be a mistake. There was both strength and kindness \\nin the man’s face. A trustworthy face, Seldon decided.\\n\\n“Grandfather,” Wanda said, rising gracefully from her chair. Seldon’s heart ached as he \\nlooked at his granddaughter. She’d changed so much in the past few months, since the \\nloss of her family. Whereas before she had always called him Grandpa, now it was the \\nmore formal Grandfather. In the past it seemed she could barely refrain from grins and \\ngiggles; lately her serene gaze was lightened only occasionally by a beatific smile. But--\\nnow as always--she was beautiful and that beauty was surpassed only by her stunning \\nintellect.\\n\\n“Wanda, Palver,” Seldon said, kissing the former on the cheek and slapping the latter on \\nthe shoulder.\\n\\n“Hello,” Seldon said, turning to the stranger, who had also stood. “I am Hari Seldon.”\\n\\n“I am most honored to meet you, Professor,” the man replied. “I am Bor Alurin.” Alurin \\noffered a hand to Seldon in the archaic and, hence, most formal mode of greeting.\\n\\n“Bor is a psychologist, Hari,” said Palver, “and a great fan of your work.”\\n\\n“More important, Grandfather,” said Wanda, “Bor is one of us.”\\n\\n“One of you?” Seldon looked searchingly from one to the other. “Do you mean . . . ?” \\nSeldon’s eyes sparkled.\\n\\n“Yes, Grandfather. Yesterday Stettin and I were walking through Ery Sector, getting out \\n\\n',\n",
              " 'and around, as you’d suggested, probing for others. All of a sudden--wham!--there it \\nwas.”\\n\\n“We recognized the thought patterns immediately and began to look around, trying to \\nestablish a link,” Palver said, taking up the story. “We were in a commercial area, near \\nthe spaceport, so the walkways were clogged with shoppers and tourists and Outworld \\ntraders. It seemed hopeless, but then Wanda simply stopped and signaledCome here and \\nout of the crowd Bor appeared. He just walked up to us and signaledYes? ”\\n\\n“Amazing,” Seldon said, beaming at his granddaughter. “And Dr.--it is Doctor, isn’t it?--\\nAlurin, what do you make of all this?”\\n\\n“Well,” began the psychologist thoughtfully, “I am pleased. I’ve always felt different \\nsomehow and now I know why. And if I can be of any help to you, why--” The \\npsychologist looked down at his feet, as if all of a sudden he realized he was being \\npresumptuous. “What I mean is, Wanda and Stettin said I may be able to contribute in \\nsome way to your Psychohistory Project. Professor, nothing would please me more.”\\n\\n“Yes yes. That’s quite true, Dr. Alurin. In fact, I think you may make a great contribution \\nto the Project--if you’ll join me. Of course, you’ll have to give up whatever it is you do \\nnow, whether it is teaching or private practice. Can you manage that?”\\n\\n“Why, yes, Professor, of course. I may need a little help convincing my wife--” At this \\nhe chuckled slightly, glancing shyly at each of his three companions in turn. “But I seem \\nto have a way withthat .”\\n\\n“So it’s set, then,” said Seldon briskly. “You will join the Psychohistory Project. I \\npromise you, Dr. Alurin, this is a decision you will not regret.”\\n\\n  \\n\\n“Wanda, Stettin,” Seldon said later, after Bor Alurin had left. “This is a most welcome \\nbreakthrough. How quickly do you think you can find more mentalics?”\\n\\n“Grandfather, it took us over a month to locate Bor--we cannot predict with what \\nfrequency others will be found.\\n\\n“To tell you the truth, all this ‘out and around’ takes us away from our work on the \\nPrime Radiant and it is distracting as well. Now that I have Stettin to ‘talk’ to, verbal \\ncommunication is somewhat too harsh, tooloud .”\\n\\nSeldon’s smile faded. He had been afraid of this. As Wanda and Palver had been honing \\n\\n',\n",
              " 'their mentalic skills, so their tolerance for “ordinary” life had diminished. It only made \\nsense; their mentalic manipulations set them apart.\\n\\n“Wanda, Stettin, I think it may be time for me to tell you more about the idea Yugo \\nAmaryl had years ago and about the Plan I’ve devised as a result of that idea. I haven’t \\nbeen ready to elaborate upon it until now, because until this moment, all the pieces have \\nnot been in place.\\n\\n“As you know, Yugo felt we must establish two Foundations--each as a fail-safe measure \\nfor the other. It was a brilliant idea, one which I wish Yugo could have lived long enough \\nto see realized.” Here Seldon paused, heaving a regretful sigh.\\n\\n“But I digress. --Six years ago, when I was certain that Wanda had mentalic, or mind-\\ntouching, capabilities, it came to me that not only should there be two Foundations but \\nthat they should be distinct in nature, as well. One would be made up of physical \\nscientists--the Encyclopedists will be their pioneer group on Terminus. The second \\nwould be made up of true psychohistorians; mentalists--you. That is why I’ve been so \\neager for you to find others like you.\\n\\n“Finally, though, is this: The Second Foundation must be secret. Its strength will lie in \\nits seclusion, in its telepathic omnipresence and omnipotence.\\n\\n“You see, a few years ago, when it became apparent that I would require the services of \\na bodyguard, I realized that the Second Foundation must be the strong, silent, secret \\nbodyguard of the primary Foundation.\\n\\n“Psychohistory is not infallible--its predictions are, however, highly probable. The \\nFoundation, especially in its infancy, will have many enemies, as do I today.\\n\\n“Wanda, you and Palver are the pioneers of the Second Foundation, the guardians of the \\nTerminus Foundation.”\\n\\n“Buthow , Grandfather?” demanded Wanda. “We are just two--well, three, if you count \\nBor. To guard the entire Foundation, we would need--”\\n\\n“Hundreds? Thousands? Find however many it takes, Granddaughter. You can do it. And \\nyou know how.\\n\\n“Earlier, when relating the story of finding Dr. Alurin, Stettin said you simply stopped \\nand communicatedout to the mentalic presence you felt and he came to you. Don’t you \\nsee? All along I’ve been urging you to go out and find others like you. But this is \\ndifficult, almost painful for you. I realize now that you and Stettin must seclude \\n\\n',\n",
              " 'yourselves, in order to form the nucleus of the Second Foundation. From there you will \\ncast your nets into the ocean of humanity.”\\n\\n“Grandfather, what are you saying?” Wanda asked in a whisper. She had left her seat and \\nwas kneeling next to Seldon’s chair. “Do you want me to leave?”\\n\\n“No, Wanda,” Seldon replied, his voice choked with emotion. “I don’t want you to \\nleave, but it is the only way. You and Stettin must isolate yourselves from the crude \\nphysicality of Trantor. As your mentalic abilities grow stronger, you will attract others to \\nyou--the silent and secret Foundation will grow.\\n\\n“We will be in touch--occasionally, of course. And each of us has a Prime Radiant. You \\nsee, don’t you, the truth--and the absolute necessity --of what I am saying, don’t you?”\\n\\n“Yes, I do, Grandfather,” said Wanda. “More important, Ifeel the brilliance of it as well. \\nRest assured; we won’t let you down.”\\n\\n“I know you won’t, dear,” Seldon said wearily.\\n\\nHow could he do this--how could he send his darling granddaughter away? She was his \\nlast link to his happiest days, to Dors, Yugo, and Raych. She was the only other Seldon \\nin the Galaxy.\\n\\n“I shall miss you terribly, Wanda,” Seldon said as a tear worked its way down his finely \\ncreased cheek.\\n\\n“But, Grandfather,” Wanda said as she stood with Palver, preparing to leave. “Where \\nshall we go? Whereis the Second Foundation?”\\n\\nSeldon looked up and said, “The Prime Radiant has already told you, Wanda.”\\n\\nWanda looked at Seldon blankly, searching her memory.\\n\\nSeldon reached out and clutched at his granddaughter’s hand.\\n\\n“Touch my mind, Wanda. It is there.” Wanda’s eyes widened as she reached into \\nSeldon’s mind.\\n\\n“I see,” Wanda whispered to Seldon.\\n\\n      Section 33A2D17; Star’s End.\\n\\n',\n",

Professor Emeritus of \\nPsychohistory at Streeling University on Trantor. Director of the Psychohistory Research \\nProject. Executive Editor of the Encyclopedia Galactica. Creator of the Foundation.\\n\\nIt all sounds quite impressive, I know. I have done a great deal in my eighty-one years \\nand I am tired. Looking back over my life, I wonder if I could have--should have--done \\ncertain things differently. For instance: Was I so concerned with the grand sweep of \\npsychohistory that the people and events that intersected my life sometimes seemed \\ninconsequential by comparison?\\n\\nPerhaps I neglected to make some small incidental adjustments here or there that would \\nhave in no way compromised the future of humanity but might have dramatically \\nimproved the life of an individual dear to me. --Yugo, Raych . . . I can’t help but \\nwonder . . . Was there something I could have done to save my beloved Dors?\\n\\nLast month I finished recording the Crisis holograms. My assistant, Gaal Dornick, has \\ntaken them to Terminus to oversee their installation in the Seldon Vault. He will make \\nsure that the Vault is sealed and that the proper instructions are left for the eventual \\nopenings of the Vault, during the Crises.\\n\\nI’ll be dead by then, of course.\\n\\nWhat will they think, those future Foundationers, when they see me (or, more accurately, \\nmy hologram) during the First Crisis, almost fifty years from now? Will they comment \\non how old I look or how weak my voice is or how small I seem, bundled in this \\nwheelchair? Will they understand--appreciate--the message I’ve left for them? --Ah \\nwell, there’s really no point in speculating. As the ancients would say: The die is cast.\\n\\nI heard from Gaal yesterday. All is going well on Terminus. Bor Alurin and the Project \\nmembers are flourishing in “exile.” I shouldn’t gloat, but I can’t help but chuckle when I \\nrecall the self-satisfied look on the face of that pompous idiot Linge Chen when he \\nbanished the Project to Terminus two years ago. Although ultimately the exile was \\ncouched in terms of an Imperial Charter (“A state-supported scientific institution and \\npart of the personal domain of His August Majesty, the Emperor”--the Chief \\n\\n',\n",
              " 'Commissioner wanted us off Trantor and out of his hair, but he could not bear the \\nthought of giving up complete control), it is still a source of secret delight to know that it \\nwas Las Zenow and I who chose Terminus as Foundation’s home.\\n\\nMy one regret where Linge Chen is concerned is that we were not able to save Agis. \\nThat Emperor was a good man and a noble leader, even if he was Imperial in name only. \\nHis mistake was to believe in his title and the Commission of Public Safety would not \\ntolerate the burgeoning Imperial independence.\\n\\nI often wonder what they did to Agis--was he exiled to some remote Outer World or \\nassassinated like Cleon?\\n\\nThe boy-child who sits on the throne today is the perfect puppet Emperor. He obeys \\nevery word Linge Chen whispers in his ear and fancies himself a budding statesman. \\nThe Palace and trappings of Imperial life are but toys to him in some vast fantastical \\ngame.\\n\\nWhat will I do now? With Gaal finally gone to join the Terminus group, I am utterly \\nalone. I hear from Wanda occasionally. The work at Star’s End continues on course; in \\nthe past decade she and Stettin have added dozens of mentalics to their number. They \\nincreasingly grow in power. It was the Star’s End contingent--my secret Foundation--\\nwho pushed Linge Chen into sending the Encyclopedists to Terminus.\\n\\nI miss Wanda. It has been many years since I’ve seen her, sat with her quietly, holding \\nher hand. When Wanda left, even though I had asked her to go, I thought I would die of \\nheartbreak. That was, perhaps, the most difficult decision I ever had to make and, \\nalthough I never told her, I almost decided against it. But for the Foundation to succeed, \\nit was necessary for Wanda and Stettin to go to Star’s End. Psychohistory decreed it, --so \\nperhaps it wasn’t really my decision, after all.\\n\\nI still come here every day, to my office in the Psychohistory Building. I remember \\nwhen this structure was filled with people, day and night. Sometimes I feel as if it’s \\nfilled with voices, those of my long-departed family, students, colleagues--but the \\noffices are empty and silent. The hallways echo with the whirr of my wheelchair motor.\\n\\nI suppose I should vacate the building, return it to the University to allocate to another \\ndepartment. But somehow it’s hard to let go of this place. There are so many \\nmemories . . .\\n\\nAll I have now is this, my Prime Radiant.
